12,sharath kamal bids farewell indian table tennis legend leaves the sport in a better place than he found it,sports
13,in some ways it was fitting that sharath kamals last match as a professional came against an indian player who considers the veteran to be his idol,sports
14,after an illustrious career spanning over two decades indian table tennis legend achanta sharath kamal played his final international match on saturday bowing out on his home turf in the round of at the wtt star contender in chennai the yearold icon fell to yearold snehit suravajjula a young indian paddler who grew up idolising him,sports
15,while the realisation of no longer being an international player will take time to sink in sharath can take solace in one undeniable truth he leaves indian table tennis in a much stronger place than he found it having been a catalyst for the sports global rise in india,sports
16,for more than a decade he has been the face of indian table tennis that his farewell match came against a promising youngster feels almost poetic a passing of the torch a sign of how far indian tt has come under his influence,sports
17,surrounded by family friends and fans sharath would have loved to cap off his final event with a deeper run especially against snehit with whom he played doubles in the same tournament he might have expected to have the upper hand but the mentality shift among young indian paddlers one that sharath himself inspired was on full display they play to win no matter the opponent,sports
18,ive been like a mentor to him sharath said weve worked together a lot but its the same with manav thakkar manush shah snehit and all the youngsters,sports
19,when asked if he would have preferred facing a foreign player in his last match sharath admitted it wouldve been ideal when you play a foreigner the whole team and crowd are behind you pushing you but thats how the draw worked and im happy for snehit hes had a fantastic tournament snehits impressive run ended in the quarterfinals later in the day where he lost to frances thibault poret,sports
20,still being in exceptional touch sharath was asked if he had second thoughts about retirement his answer was firm no regrets i made this decision six months ago he said once you decide your mind stops working toward further growth in competition i was mentally prepared this foresight helped him transition both emotionally and mentally ensuring he could step away from the game on his own terms,sports
21,but whenever a sporting legend retires one question inevitably follows who will fill the void for indian table tennis sharath insisted theres no need to worry theres a strong bench strength and i know im leaving the game in safe hands he said ankur bhattacharjee payas jain and anirban ghosh are eager to make a mark while manav manush and snehit have already stepped up then theres harmeet desai and g sathiyan who are now senior pros,sports
22,however he acknowledges that playing until like he did will be tough for this new generation the playing field has become more grueling there are a lot more tournaments a lot more talent a lot more things happening wear and tear is very high for the players its not very easy to play for a longer period of time he said,sports

25,yearold overcomes challenges posed by stomach ulcers to set a m national record with a second dash at indian gp,sports
26,it was usain bolts scorching run in beijing during the olympics that inspired a young boy in patial village jalandhar to step on the track,sports
27,seventeen years later gurindervir singh isnt close to that scintillating second dash by his idol but on friday he became the countrys fastest man clocking seconds at the indian grand prix inbengaluru karnataka gurindervir broke the previous national record of s set by his compatriot manikanta hoblidhar at the national open athletics championships,sports
28,i have been waiting for this record for a very long time i knew that i was capable of getting the national record when i did s in it was just a difference of milliseconds i am happy to finally break the record gurindervir toldthe indian expressover the phone,sports
29,at the indian grand prix gurindervir was up against two former national record holders manikanta and amlan borgohain however it is not a new thing for him as he trains with both sprinters at the reliance foundation inmumbai the three fastest men of the country were clubbed in the same group at igp with gurindervir coming on top and manikanta clocking his personal best of s while amlan clocked s,sports
30,his path however has been littered with challenges the yearold sprinter had a tough bout with ulcers in his stomach he was unable to eat anything and lost weight due to the problem leading to a sharp reduction in his timing,sports
31,once i did s in i was pretty sure that i would go ahead and break the national record but i was taken aback by the gut issue i was unable to take my diet properly as i would vomit everything at the fed cup where amlan clocked s i was unable to perform as i lost a lot of weight before that tournament i lost kg in a span of eight days said gurindervir,sports
32,was gurindervirs worst year his best timing was down to s something he wouldnt even clock at the junior level it was a frustrating period for me i had clocked better timings at the junior level a lot of people dismissed my performance as a fluke and said it was the end of my career i told my then coach sarabjit sir about the issue and consulted a doctor with him the issues were caused due to a lot of outside food that i used to eat once i met the doctor there was an improvement and i returned to the track he mentioned,sports
33,after his return in he clocked s as his fastest timing of the year but it was last year that he truly returned to his old self clinching the federation cup gold medal with a timing of s while that performance was deemed illegal due to excessive wind of ms during his race he clocked s at the national interstate championships in june to beat amlan and animesh kuju for the gold medal,sports
34,a lot has changed for gurindervir since he started training under james hillier at the reliance foundation the athlete from punjab was used to training alone without much competition and had to rely on his own understanding of nutrition,sports
35,now he trains in the company of some of indias fastest sprinters the best part of training with amlan and mani is that they push me to do better in training amlan does more weight training than me and mani has better endurance so looking at both i have to give my best such things were not possible for me when i was training alone gurindervir said,sports
36,known for his explosive strength while running gurindervir believes that starting early in his childhood led to his basics being strong i got my first spikes when i was in th standard my father kamaljeet singh is a former volleyball player and he trained me with all the knowledge he had that is the reason my basics are solid,sports
37,however it was not easy for him to adapt to the new training routine and the system under hillier who oversees the sprints programme at the reliance foundation there was a weight overload after i joined here my muscles would feel sore and i was unable to finish my training it took me some time to adjust to the new routine and the results have started coming now said gurindervir adding that his target is to end indias sprint medal drought at the asian level,sports
39,table tennis on the day sharath kamal bows out young manav thakkar creates a slice of history for indian tt with stunning win,sports
40,manav thakkar was staring at a quarterfinal defeat against lim jonghoon of korea but went on an incredible run of straight points across games it was poetic on the day sharath kamal retired,sports
41,in a moment of poetic symmetry on the day yearold legend achanta sharath kamal bid farewell to international table tennis at the wtt star contender in chennai yearold manav thakkar stepped up to carve his name into the history books the youngster became the first indian mens player to reach the semifinals of a wtt star contender event achieving the bestever result by an indian in any world table tennis tournament tier,sports
42,and it was a stunning victory too facing world no lim jonghoon in the quarterfinals manav found himself on the brink of elimination trailing in the match and in the fourth game what followed was nothing short of extraordinary in a blistering turnaround thesuratlad rattled off straight points clinching the fourth game and storming to a jawdropping lead in game before winning it,sports
43,as sharath bowed out earlier in the day losing his round of match to yearold snehit suravajjula one of the many indian paddlers who grew up idolising him it became clear that hes leaving the sport in safe hands,sports
44,reflecting on his win manav toldthe indian expressthat he had had close encounters with jonghoon previously and knew he could find a way both times i had match points and still lost the last time i was up and in bangkok before the olympics and i still lost he said,sports
45,things were looking bleak for manav at the start when jonghoon seemed to be running away with it he was playing at such a high level and i couldnt find a way in when i was down in the fourth game i decided to change the pace i started playing much faster giving him no time to think and suddenly the momentum shifted he explained at in the fifth set i was just locked into playing fast and aggressive when i reached match point at thats when it hit me i was about to win,sports
46,manavs transformation in the match wasnt accidental it was the result of training alongside some of the worlds best over the past few years he has honed his game in the french league playing for the montpellier club alongside the lebrun brothers felix and alexis two of the most exciting young players in world table tennis,sports
47,what i did today from down ive seen the lebruns do all the time manav said playing fast giving the opponent no time to react i never felt fully comfortable doing it myself before but when i was struggling i thought why not try it and it worked,sports
48,felix now a paris olympic bronze medalist and alexis are known for their highspeed relentless style training with them has pushed manav to embrace that aggressive mindset when they thrash me in training i feel terrible but it motivates me i dont just want to keep up with them i want to reach their level,sports
49,manav spends almost three to four months a year training with the montpellier club and competing in france as his world rankings are set to receive a huge boost with this performance he hopes to increase his training stints there while also balancing his time between international tournaments and training camps in india,sports
50,sharaths retirement on saturday sure marks the end of an era but the next generation of indian paddlers are already stepping uptheres a strong bench strength and i know im leaving the game in safe hands sharath said,sports
51,manav said training together with the indian group has helped everyone lift their game a strong training group is crucial manav explained we have regular training camps even before this tournament we had intense training camps in sweden andbangalore when all of us train together we push each other it creates a competitive but supportive environment it is sharath bhaiya who has to be credited for creating this competitive yet supportive environment,sports
52,the camaraderie has been translating into results inchennai a number of them had impressive wins with snehit and harmeet securing notable results when one of us does well it motivates the others to step up we dont want to just participate we want to dominate manav added,sports
54,ms dhoni at csk legend is playing to the gallery but his powerhitting is being underutilised by csk,sports
55,whether ms dhoni batted at no or or for chennai super kings on friday night against royal challengers bengaluru might not have made a difference to the result the damage was already done first when csk were sloppy on the field and later when they crawled through the powerplay losing critical early wickets,sports
56,but isnt it fun to imagine two sixes and four the runs that he hit in the last over from dhonis bat say in the th over bowled by liam livingstone when the required rate was around incidentally runsperover in a league where the possibilities with the bat have been redefined in the last year it is an interesting prospect,sports
61,but keep that aside for a minute perhaps its not ideal to expect rationalism in sports fandom the heart wants what it wants and sports fans are driven by emotions more than logic however what does this situation say about a professional franchise presumably harbouring hopes of another title by making logical cricketing decisions that benefit the team,sports
62,in ipl so far heres where wicketkeepers have batted heinrich klaasen srh no quinton de kock kkr opener jitesh sharma rcb no dhruv jurel rr no or or sanju samson when he is fit again opener ryan rickelton mi openerrishabh pantlsg no abishek porel dc no jos buttler gt no,sports
63,in the day and age of maximising resources in a t batting lineup no other team is underutilising the wicketkeeper position more than csk,sports
64,the more frustrating aspect of this is that we are not talking about diminishing skillset as it tends to happen with players when aging handeye coordination still topnotch as he has shown with his impeccable glovework with two sensational stumpings in the first two matches of the season to dismiss key batters of the opposition his ballstriking ability still right up there his base numbers for ipl were eyecatching strike rate of fours and sixes that came at a frequency of a boundary every balls he faced although he faced just balls the entire season because he was evidently managing a knee injury,sports
65,but the narrative from the csk camp this season has been how he has looked the fittest he has in recent seasons and yet his role remains the same when csks middle order is screaming for a powerhitter and a righthander to break the run of lefties,sports
66,dhonis lastover hits are the stuff of legends in indian cricket of course but over the last couple of years that is all he has been doing it worked on occasion last year like at the wankhede stadium when his cameo was a differencemaker againsthardik pandyas mumbai indians but on other occasions it made you wonder what difference he could have made by batting higher up in the order in vizag almost exactly a year ago he came into bat at no in the th over against dc and smashed the ball around when the required rate had ballooned up to it is worth noting that eventually in the season csk were knocked out on net run rate,sports
67,india vs pakistan no war no shooting just fight to be miandad joginder not chetan sharma misbah,sports
68,even a single magical stroke or a dream ball can get tagged to a cricketer forever india vs pakistan is a tryst with cricketing immortality,sports
69,however hard the tv broadcasters try to beat the war drums india vs pakistan cricket these days is anything but war minus the shooting however hard the billboard artists try to photoshoprohit sharma and mohammad rizwan to make them appear menacing the two naturally congenial captains still cant pass off as ruthless generals leading bloodthirsty armies,sports
70,that old narrative promoting crickets most storied derby has got boring and inaccurate but somehow it has survived the caricaturing of this highstakes sporting contest needs to stop indopak cricket needs to be saved from the marketers who seem hellbent on reducing this manylayered rivalry into a onedimensional clich,sports
71,it is these unimaginative war references that justify the mixing of sports and politics and the slamming of the cricket door between the two neighbours whose players famously get along and whose fans have never waged pitched battles in the stands,sports
72,this sunday india and pakistan will meet again and those familiar voices are on air again netflix has timed the airing of its documentary the greatest rivalry with the icc champions trophys showcase game its promo video has visuals of tanks blasting shells on the border and lungbusting cries by highonaggro guards at the wagah ceremony every evening,sports
74,jiohotstar flashes images of a pakistan player with a bloodied face it also has scary closeups of angry fans with war paint on their faces even ms dhoni is seen extolling fans to sledge how long can javed miandad mimicking kiran mores jumpingjack routine be interpreted as some kargillike confrontation well it has been more than years but miandad is still leaping on the screen have a heart he is now,sports
75,why has it taken the world so long to realise that the arenas where these storied blue vs green games are played arent battlefields but theatres of dreams these sporting faceoffs are chess over yards exhibition of exquisite cricketing skills and an opportunity for players to be permanently housed in the memories of fans,sports
76,nothing inspires a sportsman more than a packed house and a chance to make a lasting impression on those who have invested in them,sports
77,on such days runs and wickets carry more weight and value these are the games where legends are made and myths shaped these are the contests that give teams and players their identity that get pasted on memories for years and sometime for ever most times unfairly,sports
78,take two muchdiscussed indopak finals the australasia cup and the icc world t miandad the manipulator of strike with an expert at nicking singles is remembered as a sixhitting finisher chetan sharma with a world cup hundred and hattrick to his name cant get the last ball fulltoss albatross off his neck,sports
79,history will see joginder sharma a man with a very modest international record as a nerveless bowler as formisbahulhaq the highly skillful batsman blessed with a calm cricketing mind he carries on his back forever the brain fade monkey this is what indiapakistan games are all about and thats why the pressure,sports
80,so india might have sailed past bangladesh and pakistan might have rolled over without a fight against new zealand in their opening games but only the naive would get into predicting the result of the mostwatched game of the tournament,sports
81,its the attention of the millions of eyeballs that makes even untested players do extraordinary feats on days when streets go empty in the subcontinent go to the indopak cricket archives to find out why manzoor elahi or saleem yousuf still get free lunches in pakistan for the matchwinning s they scored against india or why atul bedade still gets asked about the four sixes he hit in a sharjah game which india lost this is why the newbies pakistans salman agha khushdil shah abrar ahmed or indias harshit rana will fancy their chances to scoop the perks on offer at the dubai game,sports
82,even a single magical stroke or a dream ball can get tagged to a cricketer forevervirat kohlis backfoot six down the groundsachin tendulkars stunning upper cut mohammad amirs cutter shaheen afridis inswinger they are still shared on whatsapp groups of cricket fans this sunday kohli rohit babar azam rizwan would want immortality in winning games,sports
83,over the years the changing trends in indiapakistan cricket results would go a long way in how the world perceived them these games were the markers that decided the collective psyche and character of the two teams so around the mid s post miandads and subsequently elahis matchwinning efforts pakistan was seen as a team with a chip on the shoulder and a firm belief that they could get the better of india regardless of the match situation pakistan were called aggressive india mildmannered and nervy the latter lost to pakistan on fridays and at sharjah india banked on this pessimism to make peace with their serial defeats,sports
84,the wheels would move with time the s brought about a change that was the time when war and regional geopolitics would see the snapping of ties between india and pakistan sharjah would get boycotted and icc events would be the meeting stage for the two teams the decade would expose pakistan crickets ugly belly their top cricketers would have matchfixing stains on them political uncertainty would further impact the game,sports
85,the last two icc events world cup t world cup show that the shoe is now on the other foot it is pakistan that suffers from an inferiority complex now india has the confidence to turn any game they didnt let the pressure of winning overwhelm them in front of over a lakh spectators at thenarendra modistadium and at new yorks nassau county international cricket stadium they performed a houdini act in the final overs,sports
86,this sporting pattern isnt quite unique to pakistan other teams too have been in this terrible place but this isnt a dead end back in the day manchester city was a nohoper team in the english league when neighbours man united ruled losses in big games and their frequent acts of snatching defeat from jaws of victory would be received by a familiar groan of typical city it was a chronic disorder that was given a name cityitis,sports
87,these days typical pakistan is often heard on the international cricket circuit this sunday they have a chance to cure pakistanitis but india wouldnt oblige this is no war no shooting just an engrossing sporting contest where two proud cricketing nations play to preserve their legacy this is a more civilised theme which has potential to revive sporting ties that the warmonger tribe has snapped,sports
88,inbl pro despite teething troubles new league attempts to breathe life into indian basketball,sports
89,indias firstever international x basketball league kicked off in new delhi in february with the intent of addressing a few of the problems plaguing the sport in the country,sports
90,when satnam singh was picked by the dallas mavericks in the nba draft there was a feeling that it could finally open the doors for indian basketball players to make a jordanesque jump to the nba years have gone by and four indians including satnam have played for the nba g league but none has made it to the nba none managed to stick around for long in the g league either,sports
91,the start of indias firstever international basketball league the indian national basketball league pro inbl pro comes after years of waiting for an international league to take roots in the country a sport that has been relegated to the state national and a dwindling international level has for long needed the bare essentials the inbl pro aims to address at least some of the problems facing indian basketball starting by creating a base for finding and grooming indian ballers,sports
92,currently a national team player gets roughly competitive games a year the rest of the year is spent practicing in gyms or being a part of the national camp a luxury only few can afford and even within that system growth isnt a given,sports
93,thanks to the revamped inbl pro a league for players under the age of with certain exceptions for foreign players which began in newdelhiin february many young indian basketball players get the opportunity to almost double the number of competitive games they get to play in a year they play with international players a rung or two above them and are under the tutelage of foreign coaches who have been part of serious basketball leagues in the past,sports
94,what were trying to do is showing that theres something else there were providing an extra avenue for competitiveness parvin batish ceo of inbl pro toldthe indian express,sports
95,while the intent of the league may be for the betterment of indian basketball it doesnt mean that problems havent cropped up,sports
96,the leagues formation itself was in doubt after the basketball federation of india bfi and inbl were duking it out in the karnataka high court and the supreme court a settlement was finally reached between both over the running of a new league in india late last year,sports
97,but the hasty organisational nature of the league has led to the first season being termed as a showcase season by batish,sports
98,in the first couple of days of the league the second stopclock at the thyagaraj stadium where all matches are taking place broke down in one match the large screen display on one side of the court stopped showing the match altogether other than technical issues the league has not been able to attract steady crowds despite tickets being sold for free online batish put it down to the league getting only four months to organise itself an act that meant corners had to be cut and one of those cuts had to be marketing the league,sports
99,there is also the issue that the inbl is currently running all six teams in the league an act that is meant to grow the teams as businesses and then hope for corporate suitors to enter the arena,sports
100,in order to distribute players evenly on a talent differential across six teams the inbl held a nineday combine essentially a talent showcase and had three groups of thirty players that came through former los angeles lakers scout gary boyson handled the combine and was responsible for grading all the players according to batish some indian players who were unknown and hadnt made the national team were found to be playing better than some of the established names,sports
101,one such player is prince tyagi who has been part of india camps before but has never played for the national team a ghaziabadnative who played for kirori mal college and jamia millia islamia university before representing uttar pradesh at the state level tyagi has found the step to the next level tough due to the lack of competitive games in the indian basketball ecosystem,sports
102,now tyagi feels that the induction of international players and coaches has had a net positive effect on young indian players who are yet to break into the national team if we play in india and play at the national level then we have plays but it is up to us to follow those plays or abandon that play and play freelance but here only a set pattern is played the gujarat stallions player says,sports
103,another aspect of the league thats welcome has been the lack of obsession with finding a yao mingtype player ming revolutionised basketball in china and was an oversevenfoot giant who towered over even shaquille oneal but whats often ignored in the commentary of ming was that he wasnt just a giant but a centre who could play basketball at the nba level the search for indias very own ming led to the hype over satnam singh and has led to an ecosystem where size was often prioritised over skill,sports
104,alex robinson jr an undersized pointguard from texas who has played across multiple nba gleague teams and has been one of the best players in the inbl pro feels that the physicality of indians isnt really the issue and that the size of indian players is not where the problem truly lies,sports
106,for smaller guys like me theres a couple of things that you just have to be able to do you have tobe able to shoot the ball when i mean shoot the ball it doesnt mean shoot it a lot but you have to be able to make it when youre open take care of the ball and you have to be a great defender he says,sports
107,icc champions trophy ben duckett adapts and resists to put on odi masterclass,sports
108,playing a long innings and dealing with the various stages and situations of the game resulted in off balls,sports
109,ben duckett isnt an orthodox opener who accesses conventional areas of the field for his boundaries however he is no less effective as australia found out as his off just deliveries took england to their highest score in icc champions trophy history staying on the backfoot cutting and flicking against pace while playing sweeps and reversesweeps to the tweakers is the yearolds gameplan,sports
110,ben played hockey and rugby as well as cricket from a young age at winchester house prep school and throughout his time at stowe in hockey he was a great exponent of reversehitting the ball and could already play the reversesweep and switchhit when he arrived at stowe james knott ducketts coach during his school days toldthe indian express,sports
111,to duckett sweeps and reversesweeps are likerohit sharmas pull shot orvirat kohlis cover drive but back in when he made his international debut he did struggle against spin former india offspinnerravichandran ashwinmade him dance to his tunes on fairly docile surfaces when england toured india the lefthander would be dropped from the team post that series,sports
114,he came to the school for a session not long after he got back his confidence was hit and he needed to get that back it took time to return but he has always been at his best when taking the attacking option knott would say in i was with the lions at the time we were on tour in uae and watching him there it felt just like he was too young and it was too early for him another of ducketts coaches julian wood would recall,sports
115,duckett had to go back to domestic cricket and do it all over again while he had decent seasons for nottinghamshire it wasnt until that he had a breakthrough year in firstclass cricket when he managed to score runs at an average of returning to the england setup whenbrendon mccullumtook over as the head coach of the test team which was in tatters at the time,sports
116,when the over world champions and t world cup winners slid in their fortunes mccullum was given the reins of the whiteball teams as well,sports
117,englands allgunsblazing approach has not reaped the same rewards under jos buttler as they did under eoin morgan there were instances during the odi world cup and even the recent series in india when it turned counterproductive,sports
118,duckett is one of the better players of spin in the england team alongside joe root during the odi series against india if he got through the powerplay he continued to play in the fifth gear even when the field was spread out his wicket would prompt a collapse while the likes of harry brook liam livingstone and jos buttler can be brutal on their day their ability to play spin and manoeuvre the ball in the middle overs is not as fluent as duckett or root,sports
119,this is where ducketts innings on saturday was significant for england he did play his aggressive shots but did pick and choose his moments to do so australia did not feed him deliveries which he could play square of the wicket with the new ball nor did the spinners bowl the length where he could play his cheeky sweeps but the opener waited for his moment he would curb his instinct to hit a fullerlength ball to cow corner or squareleg and would instead look for a single,sports
121,australia were operating with only four frontline bowlers withglenn maxwell mathew short travis head and marnus labuschange to fill the fifth bowlers quota as soon as one of these would come into the attack duckett would target them with his trademark shots,sports

403,opinionram madhav writes indian politics has failed to attract young leaders,politics
404,even when efforts were made they resulted in dynastic politics and nepotism,politics
405,as pointed out by pm modi the youth of the country are ready is the political class ready the joke is that leaders do not talk about younger ones to come forward until their own sons and daughters are ready to take over can this mindset change,politics
406,your children are not your children wrote the lebanese american writer and poet khalil gibran in his poem on children they he wrote are the sons and daughters of lifes longing for itself in principle no one disagrees with this idea gibrans poem became the basis for the platitudes that many routinely offer about the future belonging to the youth franklin roosevelt had famously said that we cannot always build the future for our youth but we can build our youth for the future,politics
407,today however these words sound somewhat patronising the reality is that not just the future but the present is in the hands of the youth there was a time not long ago when our industry businesses social organisations and even cultural activity were being led by the notsoyoung but things have changed in the last couple of decades the advent of industry has brought the power of young people to the fore with technology and innovation becoming the key to progress young leadership is making its impact in every field of public life be it industry rd trade and commerce and even sunrise sectors like social media they are part of the digital revolution ngos and social movements,politics
408,there are several success stories in business and industry larry page was just when he foundedgoogle mark zuckerberg was not even when he foundedfacebook unlike the last generation business czars like john d rockefeller and george soros who became rich and famous in their s entrepreneurs like elon musk entered into sectors like evehicles in their s and revolutionised them india too has several such examples of young people making it big in industry trade and commerce the it industry which has brought the country fame and money is dominated by young people,politics
409,yet globally there is one area where youngsters struggle to make headway politics almost per cent of the worlds population is below years in countries such as india that number is almost per cent yet according to the data provided by the un secretary generals envoy on youth less than per cent of the elected legislators are young in the un took this up as a challenge and launched a campaign not too young to run several un bodies like undp ohchr and interparliamentary union joined this campaign whose objective was to raise awareness about the issue of age discrimination and promote and expand the rights of young people to run for public office,politics
410,this remains a serious challenge in the developing world too even in a vibrant democracy like india the average age of elected representatives to state legislatures and parliament remains discouraging despite the massive youth bulge in the country the average age of the justelected members of the th lok sabha is years as per the analysis of prs legislative research group although down from years in the th lok sabha these numbers still do not represent the predominantly young nation prs concluded that only per cent of mps are below years of age and per cent are between and nearly half of the mps are above years in age,politics
411,not that efforts were not made to bring in young leaders but they resulted in promoting nepotism and dynastic politics sadly this politics which plagues almost all the major parties barring thebjpand the left parties began long ago during the independence movement belonging to a political family should not be a stumbling block for a capable leader to rise in public life but what often happens is that family credentials not capability determine ones rise fromtamil nadutojammukashmir this predominance of political families denies many capable clean and committed youngsters a chance to enter and grow in public life,politics
412,this bad practice began during the freedom movement when motilal nehru was accused of using his political and economic clout to influence the congress leadership in promoting his son jawaharlal nehru was a capable leader but what worked in his favour to catapult him to the president of the all india congress committee at a relatively young age of years was his lineage after independence this tradition continued in congress with indira gandhi rising to become party president in her early s whether jawaharlal nehru wanted it or not is an ongoing debate in academic circles because his biographers give both versions his support and opposition in this matter but since then congress essentially became a fiefdom of the nehrugandhi family the same is the plight of many regional parties in the country,politics
413,prime ministernarendra modihighlighted this irony in his independence day address this year calling parivaarvad nepotism and jaativaad casteism as the evils to be rooted out it is essential to free our political landscape from the grip of dynastic rule our mission is to empower a new generation of leaders one lakh young individuals who dont have any political legacy in their families we want to see young people without any family connections in politics to step forward lead and represent the people he said insisting that the youth will change the definition of politics in the times to come,politics
414,he reiterated it again during his monthly mann ki baat radio address this sunday stating that many youths are ready to enter politics they only need the right opportunity and guidance,politics
415,as pointed out by pm modi the youth of the country are ready is the political class ready the joke is that leaders do not talk about younger ones to come forward until their own sons and daughters are ready to take over can this mindset change,politics

436,can political strategy games like kursi build voter awareness,politics
437,a window into the minds of strategists like prashant kishor or amit shah this card game runs in three phasescandidate fielding campaigning and electionsand releases on the heels of the lok sabha elections,politics
438,as mcc theatrics keep voters hooked the indian gaming scene has played a clever hand by fronting kursi a new political strategy game that hopes to promote electoral awareness designed by zenwood gamesthe studio known for its beautiful yet thinky titlesthis tribute to our general elections is built on one simple idea every vote counts,politics
439,ahead of its launch we spoke to creators sidhant chand founder zenwood games and manthan anand strategist and ministerial advisor govt ofdelhi about their vision for kursi and why theyre trying to make politics more fun for young indians,politics
440,kursi is a two to fourplayer card game where you don the hat of a political strategist to win the majority of seats offering a window into the minds of poll architects like prashant kishor sunil kanugolu oramit shah the game runs in three phasescandidate fielding campaigning and electionswhere players must shrewdly secure victory for their party like catan this is a tabletop game that uses cards to stir gameplay how one uses them can make or break your campaign,politics
441,focusing on realism kursi also chooses to explore the grey areas in every election apart from basic cards like candidate asset or rally there are masterstroke and ahem media pawn cards in the box these can be delicately used to collect vote points how long until someone wins roughly to minutes,politics
442,developers chand and anand reveal that kursi was born out of a desire to push people to think about how politics could trigger social change on travels across india they had found that many youngsters lacked an interest or understanding of basic political processes,politics
443,i found it worrisome that very few of them wanted to get into the groundwork of politics says anand one key point that they miss is that change is actually created through good politics you cant separate policy from politics outside industry circles citizens may not have a wellrounded or optimistic grasp of this connection kursi thus aims to be a comfortable teaching aid employing a vibrant designto feel approachable,politics
444,there are systemic flaws within indian politics which require a good amount of reform points out anand by subtly nudging the change into player consciousness we are trying to show how politics should be inclusive and diverse,politics
445,this idealism is at the heart of kursis design women make up of candidates and regional differences are healthily highlighted in the gameplay of course to balance things out you will also see stereotypical sketches of candidates the game provides an abstraction of the election process without making it too complicated explains chand,politics
446,so far what have players enjoyed the most about kursi the final vote reveal moment just like their reallife counterparts,politics
447,gamifying voter awareness isnt exactly new back in the election commission had launched a video game titled get set vote to engage youngsters in the democratic process while mygov regularly conducts quizzes on the topic these are direct methods of civic education but due to their linear oneway nature lack a key component that would boost critical thinking plotting this is where games like kursi or cult hit shasn may serve as better teachers of nuance,politics
448,with crore firsttime voters this year sandbox strategy games where you have a larger goal but creative freedom on how to achieve it are known to build inquisitive mindsets in players this may eventually become an inventive way of getting more youngsters on board the policy bandwagon,politics
449,shasn a political strategy game by memesys culture lab deals with four ideological archetypes capitalist supremo showman and idealist whom players must embody before taking a stand on divisive social issues the game has amassed a global following and is a fan favourite at board game nights for players to clash their wits and manifestos but how does it compare to kursi,politics
450,well kursi takes relatively less time to play and is a card game based entirely off india focusing on just four parameters capital influence popularity and reputation its better suited to beginners who have just started exploring politics,politics
451,shasn on the other hand unfolds at a more epic scale as you sell your soul to earn resources and capture nine different constituencies inspired by san insignificant man it deals with universal political and ethical dilemmas and involves hatching conspiracies negotiations territory expansion and advanced strategy thus enjoyment may depend on players already having a fair bit of political knowhow,politics
452,either way both games are memorable entrants into the fledgling political board games space and could play a healthy role in building rational mindsets in an era of disinformation this particular club has had just a handful of members until nowthink the making of the president republic of rome and revolution come june well know if kursi has managed to earn a longterm seat at the table,politics

457,uncertainty surrounds indian elections many voters vote different parties in successive elections said chhibber who teaches at the department of political science berkeley research university of california,politics
458,chhibber said the uncertainty may exist because political parties are not present as organizations across all areas in a constituency,politics
459,chhibber observed that there are few strongholds and significant volatility in the indian elections he said that the social scientists should be careful in asserting that strongholds are commonplace in indian electoral politics,politics
460,as social scientists we should be careful to assert that strongholds are commonplace in indian electoral politics and casteparty linkages determine the outcomes of indian elections he said adding that the outcome of indian elections is too uncertain to be predicted by such linkages,politics
461,if you believe that caste voting is important and people vote their caste and peoples caste identity is not changed then we should get the same outcome again and again but what im going to show you today indian elections are very uncertain there is a lot of uncertainty there are very few strongholds in indian elections said chhibber who has analyzed booth level data of three lok sabha elections and of uttar pradesh,politics
462,chhibber said the volatilitydefined as swing of vote percentage from one party to the otheris greater at the local level at village level than the parliamentary constituency level which makes the election outcomes in india so uncertain,politics
463,according to chhibber the volatility is higher in india than in many countries,politics
464,for instance the volatility was recorded at per cent in the us while it was per cent in india chhibber said,politics

467,jasmine shah writes aap has changed the language of governance and politics more political parties now enter the election battlefield with a report card of their work,politics
469,politics is for the uneducated politics is a dirty game it is impossible to survive in politics without corruption,politics
470,these and other truisms defined indian politics for a generation of indians like me who grew up in the s and s that the idea of honest patriotic and educated indians coming together to form a viable political force seemed remote perhaps even a pipe dream just years back is a testament to how low politics had stooped in the first years after indias independence never mind that it was a few honest patriotic and educated indians who had led the independence movement drafted our constitution and laid the foundations of a modern democratic nation,politics
471,this is why theemergence of the aam aadmi party as a national partyin just years is nothing short of a miracle in indian politics born from the historic india against corruption movement in late there were few political observers who believed that aap would survive beyond the first few years,politics
472,indeed obituaries of aap have been written and continue to be written every single year since its formation some mistakes were made but aap learned from them and grew stronger with every passing year eventually though it was the sheer force of the collective will of crores of indians who for long had yearned for a platform of honest alternative politics and stood steadfast in their support for aap all these years that saw the party overcome every obstacle thrown at it and emerge as the most successful political startup in indias history,politics
473,today aap is the youngest political party to traverse the journey of becoming a national political party in years aap is also the youngest political party to form a majority government in two states delhiand punjab within its first years and gain substantial vote shares and win assembly seats in gujarat and goa,politics
474,in the process many established political truisms were demolished first the success of aap has proved that politics in india can be done without corruption it has proved that political parties can fight and win elections without indulging in corruption and that they can govern successfully without looting the state treasury it is no mean feat that the delhi governmentsbudgethas increased by an unprecedented twoandhalf times in the last eight years and the excise revenues of the punjab government have increased by per cent in just the last year,politics
475,till aap became a political force money power and political power were always seen as going handinhand money will buy you power and power will give you crooked means to accumulate more money in the process the assets of political representatives multiplied these were the only rules of the game which ensured that the poor keep getting poorer and the rich get richer till date the biggest criticism aap gets is that it works too much for the poor and gives them disproportionate benefits unlike established political parties no one accuses aap of being in the pockets of top corporate groups in india,politics
476,second the success of aap has shown that change is possible if you dream of transforming india you can do it in years of independence not a single political party can claim to have done revolutionary work in multiple fields of governance be it transforming the government schools of delhi or building a model health infrastructure system comprising of worldclass mohalla clinics polyclinics and government superspeciality hospitals providing free and electricity to residents free and piped water supply to all households free bus rides for women or reducing the wretched air pollution of delhi by per cent what also sets aap apart is that it managed to do all this in just eight years while consistently running a revenue surplus budget,politics
477,third aap has upset the most deeply entrenched status quo of indian politics that uses communalism as the trump card to win elections the us vs them narrative has been used creatively by parties from north to south and west to east to win elections in haryana it is jat vs nonjat in maharashtra it is maratha vs nonmaratha in gujarat it is patidar vs nonpatidar and at the national level it is the hindumuslim narrative traditional parties have and will continue to divide people along caste or religious lines for political gain but aap has shown that the future of st century india is not condemned to this us vs them narrative the people of delhi and punjab as well as the lakhs of people who voted for aap in goa and gujarat have shown that the politics of divide and rule does not impact their voting decision the voters of aap ask their representatives about the work they have done or intend to do not about their caste or religion,politics
478,aaps emergence as a national party has changed the language of indias governance and politics political parties going on the election battlefield with a report card of their work is an increasingly common sight aap is still the only party however that asks people to vote for them only if they are satisfied with their work and not to vote if they arent,politics
479,the most lasting contribution of aap though will be that current and future generations of indians will no longer grow up detesting politics as we did in the s but instead see it for what it is the most effective way to serve people and change the destiny of our great nation,politics

505,a matter involving buns and cream and a famous coimbatore restaurant chain has left the tamil nadu bjp with egg on its face,politics
506,it started with d srinivasan the managing director of coimbatores annapoorna hotels cracking a joke about the absurdity of gst rates at an industry meeting with union finance ministernirmala sitharamanhere on wednesday after that was picked up bybjpcritics srinivasan had a separate meeting with sitharaman thursday to clear the air this time bjp leaders eagerly put out the video on social media as srinivasan issuing an apology not anticipating the backlash that would come their way given the iconic stature of annapoorna that grew into a chain from a humble tea shop,politics

510,at the meeting with sitharaman on september srinivasan who was part of the industry delegation he is also the honorary president of thetamil naduhotels association had the room in splits when he commented the problem is that gst is applied differently to each item for example there is no gst on a bun if you put cream in it the gst becomes because of this customers now say they want the bun and the cream separately so that they can apply the cream themselves to save money,politics
511,srinivasan evoked more laughter and some understanding nods when he added in tamil nadu we eat sweets and namkeen and drink coffee together please charge a uniform gst for these the computer itself is getting stuck because of this gst confusion,politics
512,sitharaman didnt contest his observations at the meeting while adding that the modi government has been continuously reviewing gstrelated grievances even at the recent gst meeting i promised that a group of ministers is reviewing all grievances just because someone asked the question in an impressive manner it will make people who are staunch opponents of gst feel vindicated i can only say that we are taking steps to reduce the burden on people she said,politics

516,but the video was objected to by many in the state who took offence at this treatment of the respected industrialist who belongs to the influential naidu community this led to the ruling dmk and congress getting into the act accusing the bjp of coercing srinivasan into an apology,politics
517,dmk mp kanimozhi accused the bjp of humiliating srinivasan by making the video public adding this is a fascist tendency,politics
518,the controversy aligns with the dmks narrative that the outsider bjp does not understand tamil nadu sentiments coimbatore is one of the four assembly seats that the bjp which is trying to make inroads into tamil nadu holds in the recent lok sabha elections bjp leader annamalai was the partys contestant from coimbatore but lost to the dmk,politics

1059,in sandhya surissantosh a young dalit girl has been murdered and her body is found floating in a village well but its the apathy the procedural inertia and the sneering shrugs and sideways glances that come after that she somehow makes feel more criminal more evil the dead victim as these things often go is secondary the focus instead lies on how the living respond contorting themselves around the discomfort of injustice and how the system metabolises tragedy at the center of it all is the titular santosh a reluctant police constable who assumes her dead husbands post not so much out of civic duty but as the only alternative to facing the scorn of her bitter inlaws,entertainment
1060,a terrific shahana goswami plays santosh with a weary tautness like someone still getting used to the weight of her new uniform she isnt a crusader she just wants a roof over her head a paycheck and a way to avoid being swallowed by the void of widowhood but on her first day shes thrown headfirst into a case thats already unsolvable for the simple reason that no one in power wants to solve it the girls brutalised corpse lies on slabs of melting ice and the police remain disgustingly indifferent and unbothered santosh initially does what any reasonable person would do she watches listens and learns the rules,entertainment
1061,the revoltingly misogynistic police commissioner whose primary qualification for the job seems to be an unshakable belief in victimblaming is swiftly replaced by inspector geeta sharma played by a tremendous sunita rajwar sharma carries an almost subliminal menace that makes you sit up a little straighter the way you do when a teacher with a reputation walks into the room shes a pragmatist in the way only longweathered bureaucrats can be justice isnt the goal but another smokescreen a cog in the machine and her job is to keep the damn thing running meanwhile the greenhorn santosh is treated like raw material waiting to be shaped under sharmas watchful and eversosalacious eye santosh learns to savour the small everyday pleasures of power goswami plays this slow corruption masterfully her face is a study in barely perceptible shifts flickers of hesitation giving way to steely resolve the contours of her disillusionment settling in like a permanent shadow,entertainment
1062,suris direction is unflashy which is a polite way of saying she doesnt particularly care whether youre entertained she doesnt seem interested in the momentary adrenaline rushes of your typical procedural thrillers even though the film does feature some edgeofyourseat tension she builds suspense through the everyday compromises that dont feel like compromises at all until one day you wake up and realise youve become someone else entirely the cinematography leans into this trapping its characters in static frames boxed into the cramped police station the crumbling village homes and dingy suffocating alleyways of semiurban hamlets,entertainment
1063,one of the films most impressive triumphs is its use of nonactors who slip seamlessly into the screen and make you question where performance ends and reality begins theres no ostentation no selfconsciousness just people inhabiting their own skin moving through the film as though theyve always been there its this unvarnished authenticity that make the films truths feel far too ingrained to feel like revelations at all,entertainment
1064,the great trick ofsantoshis presenting power as something that never arrives as a grand temptation it surreptitiously seeps in offering small justifiable trespasses as rules bent ever so slightly until the bending becomes habit santosh like so many before her starts off just trying to survive but survival in the indian police force or any police force for that matter is hardly a neutral act the uniform doesnt grant authority it demands complicity and so without realising it santosh absorbs the caste hierarchies that dictate who is worth protecting and who is disposable the communal politics that make certain suspects more guilty than others and the institutionalised misogyny that ensures her power is only ever provisional granted at the behest of men who can revoke it at will the film never sermonises about these structures because it doesnt need to theyre simply there as omnipresent and inescapable as the next dead body to turn up in the dalit villages well,entertainment
1065,rajwar lays out the films thesis in one scathing insidious line there are two kinds of untouchables in this country those no one wants to touch and those who cant be touched its one of the few moments wheresantoshlays its cards on the table instead of letting its commentary slip through in offhanded remarks and casual cruelties,entertainment
1066,a minor gripe suri seems to flinch in the final stretch after spending so much time luxuriating in the systems grimy cynical logic she suddenly feels compelled to tidy things up to give santosh a lifeline back from the moral abyss its a small betrayal that doesnt ruin the final act so much as it reveals a faint hesitation in the films otherwise ruthless dissection of power,entertainment
1067,of course the greatest irony ofsantoshis that while it has been celebrated internationally becoming the uks official submission for the oscars it remains in censorship limbo at home the fragile wisdom of indian censors have demanded changes probably heavy ones and the filmmakers to their credit are refusing to budge and so the film sits in bureaucratic purgatory an entirely fitting fate for a movie that understands better than most why justice is never a guarantee,entertainment

1174,a meat dealers wife steals fried chicken for her hungry daughter from a family gathering of their business rival a bigshot gangster after which both the woman and her child disappear when their disappearance snowballs into an issue involving the police the gangsters son is interrupted while digging into a grand nonvegetarian thali realising his end is near after a few more developments the don pleads for his sons life to a police officer who shows him his place all the while tapping the bone marrow out of a chicken leg and slurping it in for a quick matchcut when they both meet again the dynamics would have changed in a later scene a justwed couple feast at their wedding when the police chime in with news that forever changes their lives chiyaan vikramstarrerveera dheera sooran part is a dramatic danceoff between all these characters tensed and annoyed perhaps for being interrupted while dining maybe this is a warning from writerdirector su arunkumar to whomsoever concerned,entertainment
1175,jokes aside madurai homeboy arunkumar does bring the flavours of his hometown advertised by popular cinema in his first superstar film the keda virundhu and intricate gangster narratives with themes of family friendship loyalty betrayal and revenge,entertainment
1176,and of course a lot of action so much so that this gangster drama justifies why fans love using firepower as a hyperbole it wouldnt be farfetched to assume how arunkumar would have pictured the plotting of scenes in his screenplay a series of ballistic ideas across calibres strung together to explode in chaotic tandem arunkumars film has frequent microbursts of ingenious ideas scenes with ace performers reaching their dramatic zenith rousing fan service and background scores that heighten every tension and as cherries on top guns landmines country bombs and cars explode when needed,entertainment
1177,the conflict at the core of this story is nothing new its almost donetodust in hollywood a yesteryear brute now retired into the quiet family life is forced to take one last job when his exboss comes knocking on his doors an endeavour that pulls him back to the world he so desperately wished to stay away fromveera dheera sooranmore or less falls under this broad storyline kaali a scenestealing vikram with eyes that could melt steel and his peaceful life as a grocery store owner is interrupted when ravi aka periyavar prudhvi raj who hardly smiles in this role begs him to help finish off a ruthless superintendent of police arunagiri sj suryah exorcising yet another devilish cop to save his and his son kannans lives suraj venjaramoodu plays kannan with his malayalam accent slipping through the madurai dialect,entertainment
1178,whereveera dheera sooranstands out for the most part is how information is withheld and how scenes are conceived remember the bitesized dynamites i mentioned in the scene where periyavar speaks to kaali in private kalaivani dushara vijayan a character similar to her durga inraayan signs her son to be her spy in a moment that leaves you in splits it also reminds you of a scene from arunkumars sophomoresethupathi its a passing moment but like insethupathi here too it tells how children of parents with a certain history are raised to be streetsmart or perhaps take how arunkumar through a tattoo a sticker on his moped and a routine drive home conveys effectively the endearing romance between kaali and kalaivani an equation central to the conflict,entertainment
1179,be it how kalaivani reacts when periyavar comes home or the detail that kaalis house is still under construction or that a character suffers from a medical issue many minor points too leave a big impact when they recur and sometimes get quite explosive some layers make you read the finer lines more intently like how the mobile phone isnt used merely for convenience phone calls devices dying out of charge and call tracking make big impacts this is after all a thriller set in the present and over one night when cell phones can go out of power,entertainment
1180,of course while the entire film is set in that one bloody night we do get a flashback that hints at why the film is called part it begins with a unique intermission point and ends with a thunderous scene at a police station but then you wonder if it reveals too much about kaalis backstory this was a world that didnt bother explaining the different complicated equations making you piece it all together like a stranger at a party or wait for part to tell it all this expository sequence somehow even decelerates the momentum,entertainment
1181,that is arunkumar trading tautness for star elevation and the commercial cinemas compulsion to spill all the beans the filmmaker falters in cohesively fusing fanservice massmasala ideas and his own sensibilities of this gritty rooted world of crime vikrams introduction card is designed after the title card ofsethu getting quite a response from fans but its placement hinders your immersion into this world the plot armour for the star becomes quite evident in an awkwardly staged scene but we are asked to forgive for it leads to a great callback to a vikram classic the result of this is a surprisingly tapered third act that might not do the film any good,entertainment
1182,yet even through all that vikram keeps us glued to the screens it isnt a role that lets him rest under the skin of a character he hovers over the veneer dipping into kaalis mental makeup when needed putting on the superstar sleeve at any given opportunity and he wishes you to see more of him as kaaliveera dheera sooranis what fans of vikram have longed for but it isnt just for them its a grand spicy meal at a muniyandi vilas in madurai all meat lovers are welcome here,entertainment

1365,on saturday elon muskowned spacex announced that its maiden polar orbit mission dubbed fram is scheduled for liftoff on march at pm et am ist on april from nasas kennedy space center in florida the fram mission will take four astronauts into polar orbit also known as low earth orbit for the first time in human history,technology

1369,for this mission spacex is using a triedandtested dragon spacecraft which has been extensively utilised for human space missions such as crew inspiration and polaris dawn,technology
1371,the astronauts will also aim to exit the spacecraft without medical or operational assistance further studying the implications of both short and longduration space missions,technology
1372,this startup wants to make online education more personalised with avatars and ai,technology
1373,the delhibased genius mentor is an aipowered edtech platform which uses ai avatars instead of human teachers to significantly reduce costs,technology
1374,during the height of the pandemic india saw an edtech boom with classes held digitally and teachers hosting sessions for free a paid offering was available for students who wanted additional features such as homework and tests however as enrollment in these online classes grew the cost of membership also substantially increased creating a divide and cutting off children from lessprivileged backgrounds from accessing education,technology
1375,however adelhibased startup led by a data scientist is thinking differently to tackle this problem it is introducing digitally created humansvirtual teachers or artificial intelligencegenerated avatarsthat will teach students anytime testing a new approach to online education without human teachers,technology
1376,this experiment sets the startup apart in the edtech space while reducing the cost of hiring star teachers who often receive hefty paychecks from edtech companies driving up coaching membership costs borne by parents,technology
1377,started by mridu andotra earlier this year genius mentor a saasbased platform aims to disrupt traditional educational models by offering quality education at affordable prices through generative artificial intelligence technology and ai avatars which act as subjectspecific teachers,technology
1378,each student in a class is strong in some subjects and weak in others for example some students may excel in mathematics but struggle with physics our platform analyses a students strengths weaknesses and learning speed to create a knowledge graph based on this data it generates a personalised learning curriculum it then identifies the key areas a student needs to improve on and helps them work on those concepts she explained highlighting how the startup leverages artificial intelligence to achieve this,technology
1379,unlike traditional teaching methodologies which focus on testing and grading students based on the chapters taught in class andotras aibased system goes beyond that by addressing students weaknesses even if they stem from previous academic years,technology
1380,there is a possibility that a student in the th grade has weak areas that originated in the th grade because the concept wasnt clear our platform identifies these gaps pulls relevant prerequisite topics and creates a knowledge graph in this graph the blue sections represent strengths while the red sections highlight weaknesses the goal is that by the time students complete the course their strengths are expanded and their weaknesses are minimised as much as possible by providing targeted content tailored to their weak areas that is our main aim she explained,technology
1381,andotra said the approach she has taken is very dataheavy and each report generated for a student will also be shared with their parents so they can understand where their child needs to improve andotra said it becomes easier for parents teachers and even students to identify weak points and focus on improving them by generating a personalised report,technology
1382,its ability to adapt the curriculum based on individual needs and learning speed sets the ai learning platform apart this ensures that students receive personalised attention rather than learning in a class of mimicking the experience of hiring a private tutor for oneonone learning,technology
1383,andotras genius mentor gathers data from ncert books arihant publications and the web training it using large language models llms and using artificial intelligence to generate content including lectures notes and quizzes the webbased platform utilises apis from a mix of opencourse models like visceral ai and llama and closed models like gpt,technology
1384,the challenge is not training the data rather the bigger challenge for us is that every student has a different knowledge graph and the content needs to be regenerated for each student repeatedly she said adding that scaling to a very large level requires gpus and they need to make sure that the processing speed is fast enough without any lag,technology
1385,genius mentor sets itself apart from other edtech players perhaps because it has created ai avatars meaning lessons will be taught by aigenerated teachers who are available allowing students to learn anytime these avatars are completely aigenerated we have not taken a teachers video and created an ai avatar from it andotra explained ai avatars will be interactive they will point out your weaknesses she added,technology
1386,but there are plans to introduce ai avatars of teachers on the platform where andotras team will work closely with educatorsparticularly those who give lectures on youtube or run their own coaching institutesproviding them with a way to create and offer their own courses,technology
1387,andotra agreed that having a teacher with years of experience offers an advantage we want to ensure that we are leveraging their strength while benefiting teachers they can create a course that would have otherwise taken them a lot of time by using our platform they can develop their courses and we can become partners she explained,technology
1388,andotra added that it will function like a teacher ai marketplace offering a revenue model essentially ai teachers can be customised with real teachers faces allowing them to earn royalties at times people purchase courses based on a teachers face value she noted,technology
1389,the platform covers k education stth grade and also plans to offer courses for competitive exams like upsc andotra said she wants to make online education affordable which is why subscription costs are being kept between rs and rs for upsc pricing will be different ranging from rs to rs currently the platform supports english and hindi with plans to expand to regional languages it is in beta testing with a small group of students with an official launch set for the second week of april,technology
1390,we have been able to lower the cost of courses because there are no humans teachers in the loop we are not paying salaries to them everything we are doing is powered by ai,technology
1391,andotras team works with different schools including tagore international school in delhi to test the platform we are making it ready for school use we are working on it and with the teachers as well it will most likely be completed by may,technology
1392,no edtech platform in india has ever quantified the advantage it provides to a student once we roll out our platform to schools we will measure this impact through our personalised learning algorithm and learning capabilities our goal is to track student progress and even if there is a per cent improvement in scores we want to capture that data,technology
1393,andotra believes that teachers should not focus solely on creating lesson plans as ai can now handle that well instead the role of a teacher should be to guide students interact with them more and provide mentorship,technology
1394,a chatgpt or other ai tools will not understand your personalised learning path or curate a personalised learning curriculum for you our ai platform does just that and it does so in a holistic manner she responded when asked about the advantage of her ai platform over freely available ai tools where users can simply enter prompts and receive answers,technology
1395,andotra further explained that she is using retrievalaugmented generation rag a technique that improves the accuracy and reliability of generative ai models by incorporating information from specific and relevant data sources this means that whatever information or lessons students learn from ai avatars comes directly from the uploaded documents or books in this case it will not give you anything from the web the reason chatgpt hallucinates is because it has an abundance of information she said,technology
1396,so if a thgrade student uses the platform they will receive content specifically from the thgrade curriculum its not like we will teach phdlevel content and confuse the student nor does our platform hallucinate she clarified,technology

1412,sam altman says openais gpus are melting over ghiblistyle ai art what it means,technology
1413,openais recently launched image generator seems to be overwhelming the companys gpus heres a deep dive into what makes gpus the heart of ai systems,technology
1414,as the controversies surrounding ai emulating the style of studio ghibli openai seems to have run into a fresh conundrum openai ceo sam altman while hailing the response to the latest image generator has said that the companys gpus are melting altman added that the company is limiting the features usage in essence the company is beingforced to limit how many images chatgptgenerates altman said that the free tier will be able to produce three images per day,technology
1415,its super fun seeing people love images in chatgpt but our gpus are melting we are going to temporarily introduce some rate limits while we work on making it more efficient hopefully it wont be long chatgpts free tier will get generations per day soon wrote altman in his x post following the resounding success of the image generators capability altman had changed his display picture with a ghiblified image of himself,technology
1416,but our gpus are melting,technology
1417,we are going to temporarily introduce some rate limits while we work on making it more efficient hopefully wont be long,technology
1418,chatgpt free tier will get generations per day soon,technology
1420,in elementary school we have been taught how the cpu or central processing unit works as the brain of the computer the cpu is known to handle all kinds of tasks be it running the web browser playing music loading applications etc just like the human brain absolutely no comparison here the cpu can multitask however with ai systems there is a need for something more unlike your traditional computer that does a lot of small tasks in quick succession ai systems need to work iteratively meaning they need to do the same math problems multiple times maybe even a million times over this requires massive amounts of data and that too all at once this is where the gpu comes into the picture,technology
1421,when it comes to chatgpt or dalle they demand substantially more power than video games this is because these ai systems are doing billions or even trillions of math operations matrix multiplications to be precise across massive amounts of data what sam altman meant when he said openais gpus were melting is that they were being pushed to the limit as owing to the excessive user demand they were seemingly running nonstop at full capacity,technology
1423,back to the new image generator what began as a trend among social media users soon snowballed into a controversy over copyright artists and the right to their work many ardent fans of ghibli films expressed their displeasure over the use of the image generator to colour historical events often grotesque tragedies with the brushstroke of celebrated ghibli filmmaker hayao miyazaki,technology

1431,elon musks xai buys musks x social media platform for billion,technology
1432,the allstock deal merges two of musks companies and may ease training of his ai model grok,technology
1433,elon musks xai artificial intelligence firm has acquired musks x the social media outfit formerly known as twitter for billion marking the latest twist in the billionaires rapid consolidation of power,technology
1434,the allstock deal announced on friday combines two of musks multiple portfolio companies which also include automaker tesla and spacex and potentially eases musks ability to train his ai model known as grok,technology
1435,musk announced the transaction in a post on x saying the combination values xai at billion and x at billion b less b debt,technology
1436,xai and xs futures are intertwined he wrote today we officially take the step to combine the data models compute distribution and talent,technology
1437,neither x nor xai spokespersons immediately responded to requests for comment much of the deals specifics remained unclear such as how investors may be compensated how xs leaders would be integrated in the new firm or the prospect of regulatory scrutiny,technology
1438,this development feels surprising and somewhat unexpected pp foresight analyst paolo pescatore said to a certain extent it closes a chapter in the turbulent saga of x,technology
1439,the choice of billion is not a coincidence said da davidson co analyst gil luria it is billion higher than the takeprivate transaction for twitter in and he can share the value of the xai business with twitter coinvestors,technology
1440,musk the worlds wealthiest man has also consolidated his power in washington dc by overseeing the trump administrations costcutting efforts as head of the socalled department of government efficiency or doge that has also put him in the position to potentially influence agencies that oversee his business dealings,technology
1441,an investor in xai and now in the combined entity told reuters they were not surprised by the deal viewing it as musk consolidating his leadership and management at his own companies the investor declined to be named,technology
1442,musk did not ask investors for approval but told them that the two companies had been collaborating closely and the integration will drive deeper integration with grok,technology
1443,musks xai startup was launched less than two years ago and recently raised billion in a funding round that valued the company at billion according to a media report,technology
1444,in february musk made a billion bid with a consortium for the chatgpt maker openai which was rejected with openai saying that the startup was not for sale musk cofounded openai with ceo sam altman in,technology
1445,musk competes directly with the popular openai platform and has sued in federal court in california to prevent his rival from converting from a nonprofit to a forprofit business a judge earlier this month denied musks request for a preliminary injunction that would prevent the changeover,technology
1446,the wide release of ai software has set off a flurry of investment and competition in silicon valley in an effort to be more efficient companies are seeking ways to integrate the software into nearly every part of their operations,technology
1447,as competition in ai intensifies xai has been ramping up its data center capacity to train more advanced models and its supercomputer cluster in memphis tennessee called colossus is touted as the largest in the world,technology
1448,xai introduced grok the latest iteration of its chatbot in february as it tries to compete with chinese ai firm deepseek andmicrosoftbacked openai the x platform can serve to further distribute xai products while also providing a realtime feed of users musings screenshots and other data,technology
1449,musk clinched a deal in to buy x then twitter for billion ending its run as a public company since its initial public offering declaring that the bird is freed once the acquisition closed,technology
1450,he gutted the companys workforce after the acquisition prompting advertisers to flee the platform and a rapid decline in revenue recently brands have been returning to x as musks influence grows in the trump administration,technology
1451,the seven banks that extended billion in loans to musk to buy x kept the debt on their books for two years until they could sell it all at once last month according to a source familiar with the transactions,technology
1452,this was made possible after a surge in investor interest for exposure to ai companies along with xs improved operating performance over the previous two quarters among other factors according to two people familiar with the matter,technology
1453,after the merger investors who bought the debt from the banks will profit said espen robak founder of pluris valuation advisors which specializes in illiquid assets for sure the debt is worth more now if not fully paid off,technology
1454,ai is a catalyst in our journey to net zero mahesh ramanujam ceo global network for zero,technology
1455,mahesh is also the former president and ceo of the us green building council usgbc and played a significant role in promoting leed leadership in energy and environmental design a green building certification across the globe,technology
1456,mahesh ramanujam is the cofounder and ceo of global network for zero gnfz an independent net zero certification body based out of the us helping businesses governments and communities achieve netzero carbon emissions mahesh works on creating a global framework for decarbonisation encouraging industries to adopt sustainable practices,technology
1457,mahesh is also the former president and ceo of the us green building council usgbc and played a significant role in promoting leed leadership in energy and environmental design a green building certification across the globe,technology
1458,a graduate of annamalai university with a degree in computer engineering mahesh spoke toindianexpresscomon climate tech innovations that caught his eye how the green building concept has taken off across the globe and how ai is likely to help companies and organisations in their journey to net zero edited excerpts,technology
1459,mahesh ramanujamthe first is solar power at the end of the day renewable energy itself is a big climate innovation and is the most practical climate tech on the ground given our goal to get to gigawatts by solar power has scaled up responding to market needs and is addressing the energy demand and supply gap on the ground,technology
1460,solar energy is great but its impact would be limited if you do not integrate it with a good battery energy storage system given indias geography extreme climatic conditions and energy demand variation during summers and winters a good battery energy storage system is crucial to maintaining grid stability we need to look at a system that will store excess energy from renewables reduce energy costs and discharge stored energy during high demand there is also the arbitrage opportunity if you price it appropriately and if you can release the energy during peak demand compensating for other economic shocks the industry might face,technology
1461,the third tech is passive cooling and of course thermal management is coming into focus in india we have relied on putting up more and more air conditioners the challenge with active cooling is that it puts a significant load on energy and negatively impacts thermal comfort so when you are in a building you feel like you are constantly moving between hot and cold streams which reduces your comfort so the whole idea of passive cooling with phase change materials pcm is that you integrate these materials into the building so that they absorb and release heat to regulate indoor temperatures and reduce the need for mechanical cooling,technology
1462,mahesh ramanujamthe trump administration might not be friendly to the traditional climate language that we are all used to however you know that climate financing is marketdriven and so private investors will continue to invest they may not use the earlier terminology of climate green and sustainability and might use words like efficiency or future proofing to make it more palatable to the times we live in,technology
1463,mahesh ramanujamthere are quite a few there is a company called zeroavia providing hydrogen electric power trains for zeroemission aircraft zeroavias tech uses hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity powering electric motors with water as the only byproduct offering a sustainable alternative to traditional jet fuel,technology
1464,pachama in san francisco is using ai and remote sensing to protect forests and natural habitats and to generate carbon credits addressing the problem of verification and validation of carbon credits using tools like satellite imagery remote sensing and machine learning pachama measures and monitors carbon storage in forests with accuracy,technology
1465,there is solugen in houston using biobased chemicals without fossil fuels helping to address industrial emissions solutions it is a bioindustrial startup transforming the chemical manufacturing industry by producing sustainable biobased alternatives to traditional petrochemicals,technology
1466,rumin is an australian startup tackling agricultural emissions by developing livestock supplements that suppress methane production in animals like cattle and sheep the companys tech inhibits methaneforming microbes in the animals gut,technology
1467,finally there is charm industrial which is collaborating with the us forest service and converting forest waste into biooil and then sequestering the remaining waste underground to remove carbon from the atmosphere it is a carbon removal and carbon sequestration technology charm injects the carbonrich biooil into geological formations for longterm storage,technology
1468,mahesh ramanujama green building is a structure designed constructed and operated in an environmentally responsible and resourceefficient manner they aim to minimise their negative impact on the environment while enhancing the health and wellbeing of their occupants such a sustainability idea is not alien to india with scarcity of land without the luxury of air conditioning and since the houses were passed on to us from generation to generation the idea of sustainability was inbuilt,technology
1469,this green building concept has forced the architects engineers and construction leaders to think of buildings as an integrated system earlier both structural engineers and mechanical or electrical engineers had their own plans all this would lead to an excess consumption of materials and enormous wastage now with the green buildings concept they are using materials that actually have a low carbon footprint and are trying to reduce emissions and energy load during the construction and later operation of the building we must recognise that emissions from the built environment contribute about percent of global emissions,technology
1470,mahesh ramanujamin india we have more than buildings from big airports to small offices with green building certification globally we have more than buildings that are i would say leed certified leed certification is a globally recognised rating system for green buildings developed by the us green building council there are close to a million buildings that are green certified or comply with various green building design guidelines it is a phenomenal progress that has been attained in the last years and now all these buildings are moving towards what we call net zero standards,technology
1471,mahesh ramanujami think it is a journey all green buildings have been on a journey to get to net zero but they have not arrived at it yet but net zero is an end state it is basically reducing your scope one scope two and scope three emissions to zero,technology
1472,mahesh ramanujam most people forget that software alone is not enough to drive the transformation on the ground because it is a change in behaviour that we are expecting a transformation or transition to a greener cleaner and a zero emissions world requires changes in behaviour,technology
1473,when i look at ai and net zero reporting frameworks i think ai might be able to induce the required behavioural changes it could be a kind of catalyst when we are able to provide an intervention in a very simplistic and a very targeted manner thats when we can transform behaviour and that is where ai will come in ai would not only provide customised solutions it will also draw on the larger experience of the world so you will not only get a customised solution it will provide a pathway to the customised solution the solution would be optimised by cost region or your particular situation with ai guiding you on how to reach the optimal solution,technology
1474,mahesh ramanujamwe live in the era of sensors and iot devices and so we have a billion devices connected at any point of time to the network ai can find and help us interpret data coming from all these multiple device points it also allows you to determine the optimal way to deploy these devices,technology
1475,the data collection and this ai layer above it will tell you that you probably dont need that many devices for example you may not really need that many smart windows motion sensors or devices related to ev charging stations you will finally find through ai that these devices could be optimised and you can actually reduce the footprint of these electronic devices while getting more value out of them that is where i see this going,technology
1476,obviously ai is going to help with data consolidation data synthesis and for interpretation of data to drive decisions that to me is happening already where it is going is that you will be able to optimise design and you will also be able to identify vulnerabilities it can also give feedback to the manufacturer to optimise his tech right now that closeloop feedback is not happening so the manufacturer has no clue how his sensors are being used,technology
1477,however once you enable an iot device you are also making your infrastructure vulnerable it can be targeted for cyber attacks or potential misuse ai can detect those anomalies and help to go into preventive maintenance or predictive monitoring the moment you connect so many devices it doesnt come free it comes with a price and that price is safety safety becomes a challenge which ai can solve as we connect these devices to an aibased engine which would continuously interpret and monitor the same,technology
1478,mahesh ramanujamas for blockchain i am not yet seeing a good example of a blockchain solution in the sustainability monitoring space i think the tech is good but it has its own stigma if i may say so also a lot of people confuse blockchain with crypto i have not seen good use cases around blockchain and climate tech solutions using blockchain have not happened yet and i doubt whether it could be scalable,technology
1479,mahesh ramanujami feel that many of the climate tech products and startups are underestimating the extent of the climate problem most people confuse their good intent with what actually scales in the market thats why we need to think disruptive like for example the green building concept it was a concept on paper years ago and now it has taken off the business case for climate tech is always challenging scalability and profitability is an issue now the only workable things i have seen are solar battery and wind energy even wind energy took a long time hydrogen has potential however you have to understand why and when businesses will find it attractive to shift to a different technology one has to understand market mechanisms before one thinks of tech,technology
1480,anthropic develops ai microscope to reveal how large language models think,technology
1481,the ai startup behind the claude chatbot said it has released two new scientific papers on building a microscope for ai biology,technology
1482,in what might be a significant ai breakthrough anthropic researchers said that they have developed a new tool to help understand how large language models llms actually work,technology
1483,the ai startup behind claude said the new tool is capable of deciphering how llms think taking inspiration from the field of neuroscience anthropic said it was able to build a kind of ai microscope that let us identify patterns of activity and flows of information,technology
1484,knowing how models like claude think would allow us to have a better understanding of their abilities as well as help us ensure that theyre doing what we intend them to the company said in a blog post published on thursday march,technology
1485,beyond their capabilities todays llms are often described as black boxes since ai researchers are yet to figure out exactly how the ai models arrived at a particular response without requiring any programming other grey areas of understanding pertain to ai hallucinations finetuning and jailbreaking,technology
1486,however the potential breakthrough could make the inner workings of llms more transparent and understandable this could further inform the development of more safer secure and reliable ai models addressing ai risks such as hallucinations could also drive greater adoption among businesses,technology
1487,the amazonbacked startup said it has released two new scientific papers on building a microscope for ai biology,technology
1488,while the first paper focuses on parts of the pathway that transforms user inputs into aigenerated outputs by claude the second report sheds light on what exactly happens within claude haiku when the llm responds to a user prompt,technology
1489,as part of its experiments anthropic trained an entirely different model called a crosslayer transcoder clt but instead of using weights the company trained the model using sets of interpretable features such as conjugations of a particular verb or or any term that suggests more than according to a report byfortune,technology
1490,our method decomposes the model so we get pieces that are new that arent like the original neurons but theres pieces which means we can actually see how different parts play different roles anthropic researcher josh batson was quoted as saying,technology
1491,it also has the advantage of allowing researchers to trace the entire reasoning process through the layers of the network he said,technology
1492,after examining the claude haiku model using its ai microscope anthropic found that the llm plans ahead before saying what it will say for instance when asked to write a poem claude identifies rhyming words relating to the poems theme or topic and works backwards to construct them into sentences that end in those rhyming words,technology
1493,importantly anthropic said it discovered thatclaude is capable of making up a fictitious reasoning process this means that the reasoning model can sometimes appear to think through a tough math problem instead of accurately representing the steps it is taking,technology
1494,this discovery appears to contradict what tech companies like openai have been saying about reasoning ai models and chain of thought even though it does claim to have run a calculation our interpretability techniques reveal no evidence at all of this having occurred batson said,technology
1495,in case of hallucinations anthropic said that claudes default behaviour is to decline to speculate when asked a question and it only answers questions when something inhibits this default reluctance,technology
1496,in a response to an example jailbreak anthropic found that the model recognised it had been asked for dangerous information well before it was able to gracefully bring the conversation back around,technology
1497,anthropic acknowledged that its method to open up the ai black box had a few drawbacks it is only an approximation of what is actually happening inside a complex model like claude the company clarified,technology
1498,it also pointed out that there may be neurons that exist outside the circuits identified through the clt method even though they may play a role in determining the outputs of the model,technology
1499,bill gates says ai will make intelligence free shares views on jobs and rise of india key insights from express adda,technology
1500,bill gates at express adda said that as humans we are not born to do jobs he signalled how societies need to reorient themselves amid ai rise,technology
1501,through ai intelligence will become nearly free said bill gates the billionaire philanthropist and founder of microsoft gates reiterated he strongly believes artificial intelligence will rapidly improve healthcare and education with tools like ai tutors and diagnostic assistants becoming commonplace,technology
1502,at a time when the world is witnessing lightning pace developments in ai essentially sparking fears of job displacement gates seems to be challenging conventional notions jobs are an artefact of the shortage its hard to reprogramme your brain to imagine a future without that he said suggesting that societies will need to redefine purpose and productivity in a postscarcity world,technology
1503,the renowned philanthropist was in a conversation with anant goenka executive director atthe indian expressgroup at the latest edition ofexpress adda in the span of the conversation gates touched upon wide ranging topics such as global cooperation climate change ai and indias growing role in innovation he also hailed indias digital public infrastructure suggesting how it will benefit other developing countries,technology
1504,theres more that came out of this illuminating conversation he acknowledged chinas leadership in green tech but slammed its use of coal he advocated for innovationled solutions for global challenges hoping technology leads to a more equitable future,technology
1505,this is a deeply profound advancement that at some point will change life said gates he reflected on the time when he was part of the revolution that made computing cheap he said with ai we have been doing the same for intelligence,technology
1506,gates said that ai will roll out quickly in education and healthcare he noted that it was already solving complex problems however reliability remains an issue according to him once the issue with reliability improves things like drug discovery writing software or even customer service will become more aidriven he said that intelligence will become nearly free,technology
1507,intelligence will be free so you go from a shortage of teachers or doctors to having as much doctor expertise as much you want or as many brilliant tutors that are customised personal and encouraging to your motivation he said,technology
1508,as a follow up gates was asked about jobs if expertise and intelligence was to become free,technology
1509,we werent born to do jobs jobs are an artefact of the shortage it is actually very hard to imagine this future because of the whole system of markets and pricing and education all of that is based on creating the human intelligence to provide for a broad range of services he said adding that as we get away from jobs we get a lot more leisure time and it is almost a philosophical question about our purpose,technology
1510,gates asserted that jobs will exist because of scarcity he essentially said that it will become a question about what gives us purpose when the host informed that nearly a billion indians under will enter the workforce soon and asked if ai will hinder gates said that society will produce more than ever not everyone will need to work the way they do today we can choose how to use machines the whole framework of thinking about jobs will shift he said,technology
1511,gates had earlier said that the reason the world was able to overcomecovidpandemic was global unity however two years later the world seems much in disarray with global cooperation harder to fathom i think the us is going through a period of reconsidering its global role he said acknowledging the shifting tides,technology
1512,eventually i believe it will return to a more cooperative stance in the meantime this forces other countries to step up and thats not entirely bad despite the ukraine war and unrest in the middle east diverting resources away from the poorest i remain optimistic he said,technology
1513,gates added that his establishment is about to launch a replenishment for the vaccine fund which is the gates foundations most impactful endeavour ever the foundation according to him has made significant progress in reducing child mortality gates predicted that in the next five years funding for the poorest countries may dip however he is hopeful that the momentum will return owing to innovation and renewed commitment,technology
1514,when asked about how he remains optimistic especially even when tackling some of the toughest challenges gates attributed it to his unswerving faith in technology and innovation similarly when asked about the world heading to a two degree rise in temperature gates said that it was unlikely we would meet the degree target probably not even degrees but degrees or degrees doesnt spell catastrophe through innovation we can help the most vulnerable countries adapt with heatresistant crops improved warning systems better productivity climate change is serious but thanks to innovation we can avoid the worst outcomes,technology
1515,climate change is causing significant changes worldwide and nations regardless of their size are scrambling to introduce measures to prevent the damage most of the developing nations are balancing environmental goals with urgent economic concerns when asked if it was surprising that developing countries were outperforming developed ones in their climate commitments gates said that developing countries have never promised big,technology
1516,the billionaire explained that energy access and emission reduction often seem at odds however he feels that providing energy even from hydrocarbons is essential in the short term as renewables and nuclear become cheaper theyll eventually replace coal,technology
1517,china has quickly emerged as a world leader in manufacturing and industrial production ai and infrastructure development the east asian nation has made remarkable strides in renewable energy electric vehicles and battery technology in the changing world order china seems to be poised to outpace the us on being asked what the rest of the world can learn from chinas advancements in green energy gates said that the nation has been investing heavily in research and is home to strong universities,technology
1518,the philanthropist said that china leads in electronics batteries and solar energy and indians can now use their blueprint or even improve on it however when it comes to the us he said that its prevailing tensions curtails its access to chinese innovations for example chinese evs wont enter the us market due to tariffs thats a global loss hopefully those tensions ease with time he said,technology
1519,in the world witnessed a record high of bn in foreign aid spending according to figures released in january by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd however in as many as eight wealthy nations cut close to billion in development aid which is to take effect in the next five years after assuming office us presidentdonald trumpsigned executive orders to withdraw from the world health organisation who and put a pause on us spending in aid in the next days under trump the united states agency for international development usaid has seen significant reductions although not a shutdown aid from developed nations has been historically considered a vital part of global development and humanitarian efforts,technology
1520,in the wake of these dramatic reductions in aid when asked if he felt pressured to more gates responded by saying that he has already committed to giving all his money away he said that philanthropy from rich countries to poor nations is less than per cent of foreign aid our foundation contributes a significant portion of that most philanthropy stays within the country of origin which is understandable,technology
1521,he added that with india the challenge persists he said that in the next to years he will be able to advise indian philanthropists to consider giving aid to africa but for now we all focus on our immediate surroundings,technology
1522,when asked about how he envisioned indias role globally especially with the changing dynamics in the us and uk gates said that he thinks the aid budgets will rebound he said that aidriven productivity growth may give countries like the uk the financial space to return to per cent aid commitments,technology

1570,were going to turn off the ability to share a note on posts or reels a feature we launched last year that didnt end up seeing a lot of adoption well keep exploring ways to make instagram more fun and social but content notes wasnt it were going to keep simplifying instagram where we can which inevitably means being willing to turn off features that arent widely used more to come posted mosseri on instagram on march along with a video of himself explaining the decision,technology

1581,why students must start establishing good credit scores,education
1582,building a strong credit score early offers access to better terms for education financing and housing loans or funding entrepreneurial ventures in the long term,education
1583,acredit score is a statistical method to measure an individuals probability of repaying borrowed money and a key indicator of their financial reliability this is generated by credit bureaus which collect and maintain information about an individuals or business financial activities these organisations are regulated by the reserve bank of india rbi under the credit information companies regulation act,education
1584,a credit score is a threedigit numeric summary ranging from to derived from data provided by lenders and compiled in the credit information report cir it is determined by analysing credit history including the number of open accounts total level of debt repayment history and other factors for example a person with a credit score of is considered financially responsible heshe pays loans credit card bills rent and so on on time at the other end a credit score of is a poor rating and means that the individual has defaulted payment several times and has little chance of being given new loans,education
1585,apart from the above those with minimum or no credit history fall into the new to credit category students applying for education loans usually come under this section as a result their academic background and other data are examined to consider potential for employment before their loans are sanctioned students can strengthen their credit scores by following these tips,education
1586,timely repaymentpaying the emi regularly is crucial enable automated payment or set a reminder to ensure you adhere to payment timeline as late payment can have a negative impact,education
1587,credit utilisationthose who have credit cards should ensure that credit utilisation is below of the available limit this indicates disciplined financial behaviour and can enhance ones credit score and offer opportunities for future borrowing,education
1588,length of credit historya longer credit history reflects stability and reliability in handling financial obligations and gives lenders a clearer picture of borrowing habits payment consistency and overall financial stability,education
1589,credit typesa mix of secured credit and unsecured credit portrays a wellrounded credit profile,education
1590,hard inquiriesapplying for multiple loans or credit cards within a short period can lead to hard inquiries on a credit report temporarily lowering the score,education
1591,as firsttime borrowers students often start with little to no credit history building a strong credit score early offers access to better terms for education financing housing loans or even funding entrepreneurial ventures in the long term lenders tend to favour individuals who have demonstrated financial discipline making future borrowing hasslefree a good score can unlock easy access to credit for unexpected expenses while credit should be used judiciously it offers flexibility in managing shortterm financial challenges without immediate strain by managing and improving credit scores students develop financial independence and skills such as budgeting debt management and making sound financial decisions that extend beyond their academic years as students build their credit score they gain access to higher credit limits and better reward programmes such as cashback travel points and other incentives,education
1592,students who take education loans to study usually start understanding such financial nuances early with new nonbanking financial companies introducing repayment options such as simple interest and partial interest that usually start immediately after the education loan is taken students become financially prudent from the start of their academic and loan journey contributing towards building a stronger credit score thus establishing a good credit score during this phase is not merely a financial milestone but a longterm investment for the future,education
1593,while media reports talk about indian students receiving emails from the us government that their visas have been revoked and they need to selfdeport immigration attorneys say this can be challenged in court,education
1594,the us secretary of state marco rubio said on march that the state department may have already revoked more than visas of foreign students in the country a senior state department official previously told axioscom a news website in the us that more than foreign students have had their student visas revoked after mr rubios catch and revoke program began operations,education
1595,this program according to axioscom is an effort to cancel the visas of foreign nationals who appear to support hamas or other designated terror groups the website says the reviews of social media accounts are particularly looking for evidence of alleged terrorist sympathies expressed after hamas oct attack on israel officials say,education
1596,while media reports talk about indian students receiving emails from the us government that their visas have been revoked and they need to selfdeport since loss of immigration status would invite fines and deportation immigration attorneys say this can be challenged in court cyrus d mehta an immigration attorney based in new york city speaking tothe hindusaid that the students can challenge the visa revocation legally if the state department revokes the visa the student can technically remain in nonimmigrant status in the us and will need to apply for a new visa when he or she travels outside the us,education
1597,therefore the student can still be in student visa status and continue with her studies but the student can also be placed in deportation proceedings although then heshe will get the opportunity to challenge the visa revocation before an immigration judge he further added,education
1598,also readwhy computer science isnt the only field that needs aisavvy professionals,education
1599,last week badar khan suri a researcher at georgetown university was detained by the us immigration authorities for deportation after he was accused of promoting antisemitic rhetoric and hamas propaganda it was said that his presence in the country would have adverse consequences for its foreign policy and that he was deportable under section aci of the us immigration law however a us district judge has halted his deportation proceedings,education
1600,earlier the visa of ranjani srinivasan a phd student at columbia university was revoked after she was designated as a terrorist sympathiser and accused of advocating for violence in support of hamas which the us government has designated as a terrorist organisation cyrus d mehta said that in the case of ranjani srinivasan it was unfortunately different,education
1601,ranjani srinivasan was disenrolled by the university and subsequently she selfdeported to canada using the cbp home app created by the us homeland security department for people who are living illegally in the us and want to self deport,education
1602,cyrus d mehta said ranjani could have challenged the grounds of deportation before an immigration judge and could have prevailed as the omission to not mention the detention she was mistakenly detained got released and had no conviction was immaterial and would not have changed the decision to issue the visa,education
1603,instead ranjani out of fear chose to leave the us the trump administration have created an app that allow noncitizens who wish to leave to complete the information in the app and so there is a record of them leaving the us he further added,education
1604,in the past many indian students and academicians in america have been vocal about us government policies including its foreign policies however they did not face any punitive charges and were generally free to voice their opinion just like us nationals,education
1605,during the civil rights movement in the s and s people campaigned for racial equality in public spheres shyamala gopalan an indian student and the mother of former us vice president kamala harris took part in the protests when she was a phd student at the university of california berkeley she subsequently became a cancer specialist,education
1606,shyamala gopalan met her future husband donald j harris a jamaican student who came to study economics at berkeley at the protests both were part of the afroamerican association a study group teaching african and american history which played a key role in the black power movement,education
1607,in when the vietnam war was at its peak students in america launched massive protests across the country there were sit ins lock downs and strikes in america the class of became a symbol of student activism against the government at columbia university which is at the centre of controversy now with two of its palestinian students arrested and detained for protesting against the gaza war students occupied the university in and took over it,education
1608,n ram former editorinchiefthe hinduwas a student at the graduate school of journalism in columbia in after completing his ma at presidency college in tamil nadu in mr ram said in the april of there was a big protest against the atrocious us aggression against vietnam in the campus and thousands of students participated in it,education
1609,though the protest largely revolved around the vietnam war students were also protesting against the construction of a large gymnasium in morningside heights near harlem next to columbia university as it would exclude the residents of harlem he said,education
1610,ashok mahadevan who later became the editor of readers digest of india participated in the protest at columbia university he studied ba in sociology there and then went on to do his graduation at columbia school of journalism,education
1611,ashok mahadevan participated in numerous demonstrations against americas prosecution of the war in vietnam including the famous march on the pentagon in mr ram said ashok mahadevan was one of the students who was occupying the ledges at the university he along with hundreds of students were arrested and jailed but almost all of them were subsequently let go,education
1612,unlike the current prevailing situation there was significant opposition to harsh punishments in faculty members at the university supported the students,education
1613,mr ram said that while a police raid on the university lasted about a week with the legal process underway the universitys acting president later went to court urging maximum leniency for the students the rationale was that the students were fighting for a just cause and should not be penalized or have their studies jeopardised,education
1614,however there has since been a shift in attitude toward foreign students and nationals now he says adding that any protest against israels assault on gaza is now labelled as antisemitic and is often equated with being prohamas or terrorist he said that in the support for the vietnamese liberation struggle wasnt branded as terrorism and that to him is the crucial difference now,education
1615,mr ram says that the trump administration operates above the law and that the university under threat of funding withdrawal is complicit in revoking students status he feels that this situation is far worse than what he experienced in,education
1616,apaar id is a unique digit code for students to digitally store manage and access academic records in india,education
1617,according to ministry of education moe apaar is an acronym for automated permanent academic account registry it is part of the one nation one student id program launched by the indian government aligning with the new national education policy nep of apaar id is a unique digit code that is intended to help students digitally store manage and access all their academic credits including scorecard marksheets grade sheets degrees diplomas certificates training details and cocurricular accomplishments,education
1618,additionally other educationrelated services such as admissions scholarships concessions credit management credit transfer from one institution to another internships certifications job applications and verification of academic records are intended to be mapped to apaar id,education
1619,in other words what pan is to an indian taxpayer apaar id is that to an indian learner except there is a key difference while your future employer cannot look into your prior income details using your pan a future employer or education provider could look into your prior academic credits or what you have learnt so far and your academic performance or how well you have learnt by using your apaar id,education
1620,the moes apaar website httpsapaareducationgovinfaqs states that apaar id provides a student with a lifelong academic identity with all academic records available through a central repository this is intended to enable the student to easily move from one institution to another during their entire education journey,education
1621,additionally apaar intends to also capture cocurricular details and any learning achievements during the academic life of the student the overall intention is to help create a complete portfolio of a students learning throughout their life be it formal education through academic institutions or continuous learning through skilling organisations or cocurricular learning through other institutions this seems to align with nep s vision for enabling holistic learning,education
1622,to understand this deeper consider a student progressing through schooling where they undergo curricular cocurricular and extracurricular learning experiences curricular learning is captured in marksheets and report cards which is then provided to their parents cocurricular and extracurricular learning is often not captured in these official transcripts and end up as separate certificates or awards which parents and students are expected to preserve,education
1623,as the student grows into a young professional it is the burden of the student to provide their future employers with the picture of their holistic education journey in other words on the one hand a student needs to piece together their portfolio consisting of their official curricular transcripts along with the cocurricular or extracurricular milestones for the few who choose to misuse this it leads to proliferation of fake certificates in the educational ecosystem on the other hand government and its agencies do not have a complete picture of the educational attainment levels of their polity,education
1624,apaar id aims to solve for both these problems ie students holistic portfolio and holistic education insights to government it achieves this by bringing together two separate digital infrastructure solutions that already existed digilocker which provides a way for citizens to retrieve certified electronic copies of educational certificates and academic bank of credits abc where academic institutions are required to publish students learning data via the national academic depository nad,education
1625,in other words the nad is like the central bank where an educational or skilling institution reports any learning certificate as and when one is issued to any indian learner abc is like each students passbook of all learning certificates they have received from any institution throughout their student life,education
1626,digilocker is where the certificate is stored electronically along with all other official documents such as driving license insurance cards abha card covid vaccination certificates and more digilocker is protected via aadhaarenabled access,education
1627,by using apaar id a student would be able to see their abc passbook which contains the digital versions of their original learning certificates extracted from digilocker the student could then share that passbook with any further education provider or future employer to validate and recognize their prior learning details they may not have to physically submit their marksheets which they do today at least this is the promise of apaar id from the student perspective,education
1628,from the government perspective moe and its authorized agencies could look at the aggregated data of educational attainment across all students or at an individual learner level track our nations progress towards nep goals and could plan or act accordingly to address any issues or shortcomings,education
1629,as much as apaar is in the news today it is not the moes first attempt at building such a database unified district information on school education udise one of the largest education management information systems on school education was initiated in by moe by integrating previously existing dise for elementary education and semis for secondary education,education
1630,later enhanced to udise it primarily acts as the official source for school education statistics aimed at improving moes planning and decisionmaking with respective to national education while udise data was mostly related to school setup infrastructure compliance financial details faculty details and courses offered it also captured students demographic details and special needs requirements,education
1631,when it came to academic performance udise only captures basic details such as grade studied this year previous year and whether the student was promoted or failed no data about students detailed curricular cocurricular or extracurricular learning experiences are captured in udise also udise is still limited to school level of education and is not linked to tertiary educational journey of the student one point to note here udise also captures aadhaar details of students and teachers but that field is completely optional in udise,education
1632,while systems like udise help the moe to assess educational infrastructure educational access and equity there were no systems that could help the government to understand larger aggregated holisticlearning or educationalattainment trends of its polity in other words moe needs a realtime birdseyeview of our national education in action apaar id and abc claim to enable moe with this capability,education
1633,the intention of having an official and verifiable data bank of academic achievements for every citizen seems to be in the right direction of egovernance after all we have already seen the benefits of going digital with atms disrupting retail banking or online booking of railway tickets a system that is still evolving or aadhaarbased direct benefit transfers or upienabled instant transactions and much more just as we saw with those other systems going digital we seem to have identified certain gaps with the apaar id implementation well,education
1634,first constitutionally speaking aadhaar is optional for enrolling any student in indian school education as upheld by the supreme courts ruling in justice retdks puttaswamyvunion of india scc even with udise as i stated above aadhaar was an optional data entry field and udise data capture form even recommends the following for the students who dont have aadhaar number times need to be entered in udise online application aadhaar number is nonmandatory field,education
1635,however with the introduction of apaar id and its hardlinking to aadhaar moe appears to have created a backdoor or proxymandate for capturing students aadhaar on a side note united states social security number ssn which is a longstanding infrastructure and inspiration behind aadhaar is clearly called out as optional requirement by us department of education guidelines information on the rights of all children to enroll in school india lacks such clear direction with respect to aadhar requirement for schooling which led to the abovementioned legal battle in the first place,education
1636,second moes rollout of apaar id wherein it instructed chief secretaries of states and uts to pseudomandate setup of apaar ids of all enrolled students underplaying that it is voluntary appears to have directly contradicted with the constitutional stance of aadhaar being optional to enrol in school education additionally cbse also instructing its affiliated schools to ensure saturation of apaar ids among its students appears to comply with the above pseudomandate by moe,education
1637,third such a rollout subverting established legal and constitutional channels is apparently not happening for the first time in india even with aadhaar as pointed out by identity researcher kaliya young uidai was found to have initially worked on aadhaar rollout without first putting the necessary legal or regulatory framework this seems to eerily resemble the approach being taken with apaar id rollout,education
1638,fourth there is minimal information of how apaar idenabled access to abc gives access to the students official academic achievement documents stored in his or her digilocker would those documents be copied over to apaar id enabled dashboard if so how will those abcstored copies be protected and secured against cyberattacks after all we are talking about the entire nations academic data bank,education
1639,fifth while parental consent is required for apaar id registration there are concerns about the efficacy of obtaining the same especially whether such parental consent would be verifiable under the section of the digital personal data protection act dpdp act also while there is some information on how this parental consent can be withdrawn aadhaar data that has already been retrieved to create apaar id will be retained in abc,education
1640,digital freedom advocacy groups such as software freedom law center and internet freedom foundation have highlighted this and many other privacy concerns related to excessive data collection and potentially unsecure data sharing that apaar id could enable this needs more scrutiny especially given that abc on its website seems to indicate that it intends to make this data available to thirdparty platforms apparently to deliver unique advantages including personalized learning for early education targeted interventions for k platforms personalized study plans for test preparation and skill gap analyses with industryrelevant content for upskilling programs,education
1641,all the arguments against apaar id do not seem to question the need for its existence there appears to be an unsaid or unwritten consensus that apaar id or something like that is needed the voices of reason against apaar id all appear to focus on two specific areas how apaar id is being rolled out silently bypassing constitutional rights and without first establishing proper legal frameworks and how apaar id needs to be more robust with it comes to data privacy especially given that it would handle data of students who are legal minors,education
1642,given indias demographic trajectory over the upcoming decades nep s vision for enabling holistic learning at scale and indias aspiration for unprecedented economic growth apaar and abc seem to be the right baby steps all we need to now ensure is that we dont stumble too much as the baby learns to walk and not learning from its past mistakes,education

2004,novel cancer therapy works for per cent indian patients in clinical trials why the lancet report is significant,health_and_medicine
2005,this is the first clinical trial of car tcell therapy from india to be published in journal,health_and_medicine
2006,the clinical trial results of indias first car tcell therapy published in the lancet show that it worked for nearly per cent of patients,health_and_medicine
2007,these results come from the phase i and ii trials of the therapy where researchers assess its safety and effectiveness against a given condition,health_and_medicine
2008,this is the first clinical trial of a car tcell therapy from india to be published in an international journal this is really a world class innovation done within the country the treatment has been found to be comparable to others approved globally and the cost is th of those therapies this will improve access and affordability of such highendcancertreatments the lancet commentary said,health_and_medicine
2009,what is car tcell therapy,health_and_medicine
2010,car tcell therapy or chimeric antigen receptor tcell therapy trains the bodys own immune cells to identify and destroy cancer cells this treatment is designed for specific types of blood cancer and is given to patients whose cancer has either relapsed or not responded to firstline treatment,health_and_medicine
2011,based on unpublished yettobe peerreviewed results indias drug regulator had granted approval for this therapy in it is now available at several hospitals across india including apollo fortis amrita and max among others,health_and_medicine
2012,given that the treatment is novel and intended for cancer patients with no other options the regulator allowed the company a startup incubated in iit bombay called immunoact to forgo a large phase iii clinical trial to demonstrate its efficacy in a broader population however the company must follow up with all patients who receive the therapy for years,health_and_medicine
2013,what were the lancet findings,health_and_medicine
2014,along with a response rate of the study reported an average six months survival without any progression in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia patients and four months in lymphoma patients,health_and_medicine
2016,while the response rate was found to be similar to other therapies approved across the world there was high incidence of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis a serious but known complication of car t therapies where the immune cells get uncontrollably activated leading to hyper inflammation and organ damage,health_and_medicine
2017,this complication was seen in of the study participants leading to the death of at least one of the patients the study reported one other treatmentrelated death caused by bleeding in the lungs and multiorgan failure,health_and_medicine
2018,the most common side effects reported by the study were anaemia in participants thrombocytopenia low platelet count increasing the risk of bleeding in patients neutropenia low count of white blood cells called neutrophils in patients and febrile neutropenia neutropenia along with fever in of the patients these were already extremely sick cancer patients who failed to respond to other treatments,health_and_medicine
2019,how does the therapy work,health_and_medicine
2020,for any car tcell therapy a patients immune tcells are collected by filtering their blood these cells are then engineered in a lab to add receptors that can bind with cancer cells these cells are then multiplied and infused in the patient usually the cancer cells are adept at evading the unmodified t cells the treatment developed in india is meant for patients with two types of blood cancers that affect the b cells acute lymphoblastic leukemia and large b cell lymphomas,health_and_medicine
2021,why is the treatment important,health_and_medicine
2022,access to cuttingedge cancer treatment like car tcell therapy remains restricted to a handful of countries owing to the technological challenges as well as the cost associated with the treatment the only countries or regions with access to at least one anticd car tcell product are the usa eu uk japan australia singapore israel switzerland brazil south korea canada and china the commentary said,health_and_medicine
2023,the commentary states approved car tcell products cost us and clinical care and possible relocation expenses bring the total treatment cost to over us this therapy was marketed at a relatively low cost of approximately us this translates to around rs lakh,health_and_medicine
2024,need obesity and weight loss surgery but worried about costs now insurance cover is easy,health_and_medicine
2025,bariatric surgeries entail a layered verification process that delays approvals but things are moving as surgeries go up,health_and_medicine
2026,for a long time kolkatabased dr ratul pal had been battling weight issues because of his severe arthritic knees and was barely able to move around his obesity posed a serious health threat and doctors advised bariatric surgery because of the combined risk of diabetes hypertension and high levels of lipids in his blood,health_and_medicine
2027,i planned a surgery in but although insurance cover for bariatric surgery was introduced in i had a waiting period given my preexisting conditions finally my surgery was done on october at manipal hospital dwarka and my insurance covered my bill of rs lakh from kg my current weight is around kg says dr pal who has not faced any side effects or complications the osteoarthritic knee problem has gone down by per cent i am not taking any medicine for cholesterol or hypertension i am not taking any blood sugarlowering drugs either and managing to build in some activity adds dr pal,health_and_medicine
2028,many others with morbid obesity where the body mass index bmi calculated by dividing body weight in kilograms by height in metres squared m is or higher have got relief doctors say that with bariatric surgeries between rs and lakh now being covered by different health insurance schemes there has been an uptick in their numbers over the last few years even in private hospitals dr arun prasad surgical gastroenterologist bariatric surgery indraprastha apollo hospitalsdelhi says the number of patients seeking surgeries has gone up by oneandahalf times on an average from a year in to now,health_and_medicine
2029,gaurav shrivastav delhibased financial and insurance adviser predicts that with the inclusion of bariatric surgery in family health insurance plans individual health plans and even a critical illness insurance policy up to per cent people are expected to benefit in rural areas and up to per cent in urban areas,health_and_medicine
2030,what are the conditions for coverage,health_and_medicine
2031,the patient should be at least years old the surgeon should confirm that the applicant has class iii obesity extreme obesity with a bmi of or a class ii obesity with a bmi between and along with a comorbidity that could be uncontrolled diabetes cardiovascular disease history of coronary artery disease with a surgical intervention such as bypass or angioplasty fatty liver and cardiopulmonary problems arising out of conditions like severe obstructive sleep apnea osa,health_and_medicine
2032,insurance doesnt cover surgeries done for cosmetic reasons neither does it cover obesity due to psychiatric and eating disorders obesity due to certain drugs and untreated hormonal imbalances,health_and_medicine
2033,dr sandeep aggarwal laparoscopic bariatric gi and renal transplant surgeon at manipal hospital dwarka who conducted dr pals surgery in says the cutoffs need to go down last year the international federation for surgery of obesity and metabolic disorders lowered the cutoff for bmi because theres so much evidence now about the safety and efficacy of surgery over other means so international cutoffs are and but insurance companies here still follow old standards they want to minimise the number of patients says dr aggarwal,health_and_medicine
2034,according to dr prasad the irda insurance regulatory and development authority has given clear guidelines that help patients opt for lifesaving surgeries any patient who has an insurance over four years old and a bmi of plus is eligible for surgery he says,health_and_medicine
2035,why is claiming insurance a cumbersome process,health_and_medicine
2036,i sent my test reports and my policy documents to the hospital there was a lot of to and fro between my doctor and my insurance company for full approval most plans have an initial waiting period of around days if you have preexisting conditions like i did you may have to wait for one to three years my surgery was slotted when the insurance company gave an approval for more than per cent of costs after the surgery we submitted documents and i got almost rs as reimbursement i had to pay only rs from my pocket says dr pal,health_and_medicine
2037,dr aggarwal says such scrutiny happens because bariatric surgeries in india are newer compared to the west some insurance companies still have a waiting period of two to three years before they allow patients to be reimbursed but some corporate insurance policies now cover it straight away he says,health_and_medicine
2039,dr prasad who has had to intervene in claims resolution says the insurance companies raise a lot of questions and we have to literally fight justifying why the patient needs it sometimes the insurance company asks the patient to pay up first and then claim reimbursement postsurgery however hes seeing things improving over the years,health_and_medicine
2040,most claims are rejected over eligibility issues many insurers require specific preapproval steps such as documented weightloss attempts by the patient dietitian consultations or psychological evaluations they want to be sure that the bariatric surgery is being done as a lifesaving option they need evidence that previous treatment plans had been followed but did not yield desired results says shrivastav,health_and_medicine
2041,some insurers while adhering to criteria like bmi and comorbid conditions may factor in the patients age also bariatric surgeries are of various types like gastric bypass reducing stomach size and connecting it directly to the small intestine bypassing a portion of both sleeve gastrectomy removing a large portion of the stomach and adjustable gastric banding placing a silicone band around the upper part of the stomach to create a smaller pouch limiting food intake and promoting weight loss this variability means that each patients coverage details need to be carefully reviewed and crossreferenced with insurer requirements says dr aggarwal,health_and_medicine
2042,bariatric surgeries need preauthorisation and the process involves gathering specific documentation such as medical necessity forms and physician referrals any missing or inaccurate documentation can lead to delays or denials however as people regain their health and quality of life insurers are gradually easing barriers says shrivastav,health_and_medicine
2043,stress raises stroke risk in younger women neurologist tells you how to unwind,health_and_medicine

2113,alzheimers disease is usually associated with old age but around of all alzheimers cases occur in people under the age of earlyonset alzheimers disease progresses more rapidly and often strikes people in the prime of their lives treatment options remain limited,health_and_medicine
2114,but new data from a recent clinical trial suggests that a previously discontinued experimental drug called gantenerumab could help the study found that gantenerumab reduced the buildup of amyloid plaques one of the hallmarks ofalzheimers disease in the brain this may help slow cognitive decline in people with earlyonset alzheimers,health_and_medicine
2115,earlyonset alzheimers is often linked to genetic mutations in three specific genes these mutations cause the brain to produce excessive amounts of amyloid beta a protein that clumps together to form plaques these plaques disrupt brain function leading to memory loss,health_and_medicine
2116,earlyonset alzheimers advances quickly and the rapid decline is devastating thats why researchers are racing to find treatments that can slow the disease,health_and_medicine
2117,the recent clinical trial was a randomised placebocontrolled study to evaluate gantenerumabs effects on people with earlyonset alzheimers researchers monitored changes in the participants cognitive abilities and also used brain imaging and blood biomarkers the presence of specific proteins in the blood which are linked to alzheimers to track the diseases progress throughout the study,health_and_medicine
2118,the trial included participants with rare inheritedgenetic mutationsknown to cause earlyonset alzheimers these participants were either asymptomatic or had mild alzheimers symptoms at the start of the study,health_and_medicine
2119,the results were intriguing in a subgroup of participants who hadnt had any cognitive issues at the start of the study taking the treatment for an average of eight years reduced the risk of developing symptoms from a nearly likelihood to brain scans also showed a notable decrease in amyloid buildup,health_and_medicine
2120,gantenerumab is a monoclonal antibody a labengineered protein designed to attach to amyloid beta in the brain by binding to these plaques it signals the immune system to clear them away this may potentially slow alzheimers progression,health_and_medicine
2121,the drug works by engaging microglial cells these are the brains primary immune defenders microglia constantly monitor the brain for damage and remove harmful substances including amyloid beta however in people with alzheimers disease microglia often fail to clear plaques efficiently gantenerumab enhances this natural defence mechanism by tagging amyloid plaques making them easier for the microglia to recognise and break down,health_and_medicine
2122,amyloid beta is thought to play a central role in alzheimers by triggering inflammation interfering with cell communication and ultimately killing neurons by removing these plaques gantenerumab may help to protect brain function however it doesnt reverse existing damage which is why early intervention is critical,health_and_medicine
2123,an advantage of gantenerumab is that it can cross the bloodbrain barrier the protective shield that blocks many drugs and harmful substances from reaching the brain this allows it to act directly on amyloid plaques making it more effective than some earlier treatments that struggled with drug delivery,health_and_medicine
2124,but as promising as these results are gantenerumab isnt without risks,health_and_medicine
2125,a major concern is amyloidrelated imaging abnormalities these are swelling or small spots of bleeding in the brain that show up on mri scans this is a common sideeffect of amyloidtargeting therapies,health_and_medicine
2126,in this latest trial of participants experienced these amyloidrelated imaging abnormalities including small brain bleeds in of participants brain swelling in of participants and iron deposits from bleeding in while no participants had majorbrain haemorrhagesor died from the treatment these sideeffects remain a serious concern requiring regular monitoring through brain scans,health_and_medicine
2127,another limitation is the modest cognitive benefit observed in the trial while gantenerumab reduced amyloid plaques the extent to which this translates into meaningful improvements in memory and thinking skills remains unclear,health_and_medicine
2128,gantenerumab is also expensive to manufacture which could make widespread access difficult if it gains regulatory approval as this is an experimental drug we do not currently know how much it would cost but other similar antiamyloid therapies such as donanemab currently cost around per patient per year,health_and_medicine
2129,the study also had a small sample size and only focused on a rare genetic form of earlyonset alzheimers more research is needed to see how these results may apply to the wider dementia community,health_and_medicine
2130,although the trial was terminated early after the studys sponsor pulled out these findings contribute to the ongoing debate over the causes of alzheimers disease,health_and_medicine
2131,according to the amyloid hypothesis the buildup of amyloid plaques in the brain is the main cause of alzheimers disease clearing these plaques will slow the diseases progression the success of the alzheimers drugs lecanemab donanemab and now gantenerumab lend themselves to this theory,health_and_medicine
2132,this study also underscores the importance of early diagnosis amyloidtargeting therapies appear to work best in the early stages of alzheimers before significant brain damage occurs advances in biomarker testing including blood tests and brain scans could help identify atrisk people sooner this would improve the effectiveness of drugs such as gantenerumab,health_and_medicine
2133,although gantenerumab is not a cure and was discontinued by its manufacturer in because it failed to demonstrate efficacy in slowing the progression of alzheimers disease this new data could perhaps lead to gantenerumab being manufactured again it also represents another step forward in the fight against alzheimers,health_and_medicine
2134,alzheimers research is advancing faster than ever before whether a success or a setback each new study adds to our understanding of the disease and brings us closer to more effective treatments for now the gantenerumab trial offers a hopeful sign that scientists are making progress in slowing the course of this devastating condition,health_and_medicine

2140,he also mentioned noticing a droop in his face and experiencing issues with reading and writing adding that he anticipates a full recovery within three to six months,health_and_medicine
2141,a stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked or reduced and brain cells tend to lose oxygen and die this can happen because of a clot ischemic stroke or a burst blood vessel hemorrhagic stroke,health_and_medicine
2142,according to dr pankaj agarwal head of the department of neurology gleneagles hospital parelmumbai the common causes of a stroke are high blood pressure family history diabetes smoking and heart disease,health_and_medicine
2143,the recovery after a stroke varies from one individual to another when talking about recovery after months physically some regain movement while others may stillstrugglewith weakness or coordination and will be dependent on family members said dr agarwal,health_and_medicine
2144,some patients memory speech and emotional health can improve however fatigue and depression are also seen in a few patients and they tend to be manageable as time passes noted dr agarwal,health_and_medicine
2145,to aid recovery after a stroke dr agarwal said patients are required to opt for physical therapy speech exercises a balanced diet andmental stimulationto help regain lost functions,health_and_medicine

2147,quilts gloves topi mota socks hina khan recalls shivering and feeling extremely cold during chemotherapy,health_and_medicine
2148,this is how i slept throughout my chemotherapy added hina khan,health_and_medicine
2149,hina khancontinues to document her breast cancer journey on social media and in various interviews in a recent podcast she opened up about feeling extremely cold during and after her chemotherapy sessions i used to sleep in three quilts at night throughout my chemotherapy journey three quilts gloves topi cap mota socks thick socks this is how i slept throughout my chemotherapy i used to feel so cold i used to shiverkhan toldpinkvilla,health_and_medicine
2150,taking a cue from her revelation lets understand the connection between the two,health_and_medicine
2151,dr ravi wategaonkar director medical oncology tgh oncolifecancercentre said that chemotherapy is effective in treating cancer and improving the quality of life of a patient common side effects include fatigue nausea and vomiting hair loss loss of appetite weakened immunity fatigue constipation diarrhoea and mouth sores the side effects vary from person to person and one shouldnt panic as they subside within a few days said dr wategaonkar,health_and_medicine
2152,dr nithin sg consultant medical oncology at the ck birla hospitaldelhi added that chemotherapy can affect thebodys ability to regulate temperature leading to sensations of excessive cold or heat this occurs due to various factors including direct interference with the brains temperature control mechanisms autonomic nervous system dysfunction peripheral neuropathy and anemia some patients experience cold intolerance while others may have hot flashes and night sweats said dr nithin,health_and_medicine
2153,dr nithin quoted studies suggesting that around per cent of patients undergoing chemotherapy report some form of temperature dysregulation he however said that it is not a universal symptom,health_and_medicine
2154,the severity and type of temperature fluctuations can vary based on the specific chemotherapy drugs used the patients overall health nutritional status and the presence of infections noted dr nithin,health_and_medicine
2155,in some cases chemotherapyinduced nerve damage neuropathy can lead to a persistent feeling of cold particularly in the hands and feet additionally chemotherapyinduced anemia reduces oxygen supply to tissues which can further contribute to cold sensations elaborated dr nithin,health_and_medicine
2156,one of the most critical factors to consider is the risk ofinfection as chemotherapy weakens the immune system infections can sometimes cause an unusual drop in body temperature making it crucial for patients experiencing persistent chills or cold sensitivity to seek medical attention if a patient feels excessively cold they should monitor for other symptoms like fatigue dizziness or any signs of infection suggested dr nithin,health_and_medicine
2157,experts urge that staying hydrated dressing in warm layers maintaining good nutrition and consulting a doctor for potential underlying issues such as anemia or infection can help manage these symptoms effectively,health_and_medicine
2158,consulting a doctor for symptom management and staying proactive in selfcare can help reduce discomfort and improve overall wellbeing during treatment,health_and_medicine
2159,managing side effects involves a combination of lifestyle adjustments diet and hydration eat small nutrientrich meals including protein whole grains fruits and vegetables to stay active and energized one can ensure proper hydration by drinking adequate water adequate rest and regular checkups ensure better symptom management said dr wategaonkar,health_and_medicine
2160,cancer patients must focus on their diet while undergoing chemotherapy doing so can help maintain strength supportimmunity eating small frequent meals and avoiding processed or spicy foods can also help manage nausea and improve overall wellbeing during treatment one can also take the help of an expert regarding what to eat and what to avoid from the diet said dr wategaonkar,health_and_medicine
2161,chronic kidney disease often goes undiagnosed but early detection can prevent severe outcomes,health_and_medicine
2162,kidneys have multiple functions but their most critical and unglamorous job is filtering waste out of the body,health_and_medicine
2164,for a disease afflicting million people in the us chronic kidney disease flies under the radar only half the people who have it are formally diagnosed,health_and_medicine
2165,the consequences of advanced chronic kidney disease are severe when these essential organs can no longer do their job of filtering waste products from the blood patients need intensive medical interventions that gravely diminish their quality of life,health_and_medicine
2166,as an assistant professor of nursing and an expert in population health i study strategies for improving patients awareness of chronic kidney disease my research shows that patients with earlystagechronic kidney diseaseare not getting timely information from their health care providers about how to prevent the condition from worsening,health_and_medicine
2167,heres what you need to know to keep your kidneys healthy,health_and_medicine
2168,kidneys have multiple functions but their most critical and unglamorous job is filtering waste out of the body when your kidneys are working well they get rid of everyday byproducts from your normal metabolism by creating urine they also help keep your blood pressure stable your electrolytes balanced and your red blood cell production pumping,health_and_medicine
2169,the kidneys work hard around the clock over time they can become damaged by acute experiences like severe dehydration or acquire chronic damage from years of high blood pressure or high blood sugar sustained damage leads to chronically impaired kidney function which can eventually progress to kidney failure,health_and_medicine
2170,kidneys that have failed stop producing urine which prevents the body from eliminating fluids this causes electrolytes like potassium and phosphate to build up to dangerous levels the only effective treatments are to replace the work of the kidney with a procedure called dialysis or to receive a kidney transplant,health_and_medicine
2171,kidney transplantsare the gold standard treatment and most patients can be eligible to receive them but unless they have a willing donor they can spend an average of five years waiting for an available kidney,health_and_medicine
2172,most patients with kidney failure receive dialysis which artificially replicates the kidneys job of filtering waste and removing fluid from the body dialysis treatment is extremely burdensome patients usually have to undergo the procedure multiple times per week with each session taking several hours and it comes with a major risk of death disability and serious complications,health_and_medicine
2173,in the us the biggest contributors to developing chronic kidney disease are high blood pressure and diabetes up to of people with diabetes and as many as of people with high blood pressure develop chronic kidney disease,health_and_medicine
2174,the problem is as with high blood pressure people with earlystage chronic kidney disease almost never experience symptoms clinicians can test a patients overall kidney function using a measure called the estimated glomerular filtration rate current guidelines recommend that everyone particularly people with risk factors like high blood pressure and diabetes get their kidney function routinely tested to ensure the condition doesnt progress silently,health_and_medicine
2175,early treatment for kidney disease often relies on managing high blood pressure and diabetes new medications called sglt inhibitors originally developed to treat diabetes may be able to directly protect the kidneys themselves even in people who dont have diabetes,health_and_medicine
2176,patients with earlystage kidney disease can benefit from knowing their kidney function scores and from treatment innovations like sglt inhibitors but only if they are successfully diagnosed and can discuss treatment options during routine visits with their health care providers,health_and_medicine
2177,early treatment for chronic kidney disease often gets overlooked during routine clinical care in fact as many as onethird of patients with kidney failure have no record of health care treatment for their kidneys in the early stages of their disease,health_and_medicine
2178,even if a diagnosis for chronic kidney disease is noted in a patients medical record their provider might not discuss it with them as few as of people with the disease are aware that they have it,health_and_medicine
2179,thats partly due to the constraints of the us health care system the diagnosis treatment and monitoring of earlystage chronic kidney disease occurs mostly in the primary care setting however primary care visit time is limited by insurance company reimbursement policies especially with patients who have multiple health problems doctors may prioritize more noticeably pressing concerns,health_and_medicine
2180,the result is that many clinicians put off addressing chronic kidney disease until symptoms emerge or test results worsen often leaving earlystage patients undiagnosed andpoorly informed about the disease research shows that people who are nonwhite female and of lower socioeconomic status or education level are most likely to fall into this gap,health_and_medicine
2181,but patients are eager for this knowledge according to a study i coauthored i interviewed patients who had earlystage kidney disease about their experiences receiving care in their responses patients expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of information they received from their health care providers and voiced a strong interest in learning more about the disease,health_and_medicine
2182,as kidney disease progresses to the later stages patients get treated by kidney specialists called nephrologists who provide patients with targeted treatment and more robust education but by the time patients progress to latestage disease or even kidney failure many symptoms cant be reversed and the disease is much harder to manage,health_and_medicine
2183,people who are at risk for chronic kidney disease or who have developed earlystage disease can take several steps to minimize the chances that it will progress to kidney failure,health_and_medicine
2184,first patients can ask their doctors about chronic kidney disease especially if they have risk factors such as high blood pressure or diabetes studies show that patients who ask questions make requests and raise concerns with their provider during their health care visit have better health outcomes and are more satisfied with their care,health_and_medicine
2185,some specific questions to ask include am i at risk of developing chronic kidney disease and have i been tested for chronic kidney disease to help patients start these conversations at the doctors office researchers are working to develop digital tools that visually represent a patients kidney disease test results and risks these graphics can be incorporated into patients medical records to help spur conversations during a health care visit about their kidney health,health_and_medicine
2186,studies show that patients with chronic kidney disease who have a formal diagnosis in their medical records receive better care in line with current treatment guidelines and experience slower disease progression such patients can ask how quickly is my chronic kidney disease progressing and how can i monitor my test results they may also want to ask what is my treatment plan for my chronic kidney disease and should i be seeing a kidney specialist in our research we saw that patients with chronic kidney disease who had seen a loved one experience dialysis treatment were especially motivated to stick with their treatment to prevent kidney failure,health_and_medicine
2187,but even without the benefit of direct experience the possibility of kidney failure may motivate patients to follow their health care providers recommendations to eat a healthy diet get regular physical activity and take their medications as prescribed,health_and_medicine
2188,this is what will happen to the body if you abruptly stop taking thyroid medication,health_and_medicine
2189,conducting regular monitoring of thyroid function tests and evaluating any potential side effects or changes in health status that may arise during treatment is crucial,health_and_medicine
2190,if you suffer from thyroid you would be advised to take medication every day of your life but you might find it unnecessary to continue with the pills if you feel your symptoms are under control however before you pull the plug by yourself you might want to learn about a few ifs and buts we spoke to a health expert to find out what happens to the body when you abruptly stop taking your thyroid medication,health_and_medicine
2191,when an individual discontinues their thyroid medication the body undergoes several physiological changes that can significantly impact overall health thethyroidgland which regulates metabolism energy levels and various bodily functions may struggle to maintain adequate hormone production without the supplemental medication as a result symptoms of hypothyroidism such as fatigue weight gain depression and sensitivity to cold may reemerge or worsen said dr mahesh d m consultant endocrinology aster cmi hospitalbangalore,health_and_medicine
2192,he added that the bodys metabolic processes can slow down leading to a decrease in energy levels and potential weight gain therefore it is crucial for patients to consult with healthcare professionals before making any changes to their medication regimen,health_and_medicine
2193,the discontinuation of thyroid medication may pose both immediate and prolonged health risks those who rely on these medications to regulate thyroid hormone levels could experience a range of adverse effects including hair fall fluctuations in energy levels mood disturbances menstrual disturbances and metabolic imbalances in the short term dr mahesh listed symptoms such as fatigue weight gain and cognitive difficulties may arise as the body adjusts to the absence of medication,health_and_medicine
2194,dr anusha nadig consultant endocrinology fortis hospital bannerghatta roadbengaluru shared that stoppingthyroidmedication can lead to longterm risks including an increased risk of heart disease osteoporosis infertility cognitive decline and depression untreated hypothyroidism can also increase the risk of miscarriage premature birth and birth defects during pregnancy she added,health_and_medicine
2195,typically dr mahesh suggests taking these medications once daily preferably in the morning on an empty stomach to maintain consistent hormone levels however the specific dosage and frequency can vary based on individual health needs the type ofthyroiddisorder being treated and the patients response to the medication,health_and_medicine
2196,usually thyroid medication needs to be continued long term however in some patients to discontinue thyroid medication is a subtle decision that should be made in consultation with doctors according to dr mahesh factors influencing this decision may include the stabilization of thyroid hormone levels the resolution of symptoms associated with thyroid dysfunction or the successful management of underlying conditions that necessitated the medication in the first place,health_and_medicine
2197,he stressed the need to monitor thyroid function tests regularly and evaluate any potential side effects or changes in health status that may arise during treatment,health_and_medicine

2314,about of americans say they have chronic insomnia and millions of others report poor sleep quality ongoing research has found that bad sleep could lead to numerous health problems including heart disease,health_and_medicine
2315,dr julio fernandezmendoza is a professor of psychiatry and behavioral health neuroscience and public health sciences at penn state college of medicine he discusses the need for sleep why teenagers require more sleep than adults and how you can get a good nights sleep without medications,health_and_medicine
2316,julio fernandezmendozaadults who report getting about seven to eight hours of sleep per nightgenerally have the best health in terms of both physical and mental health and longevity,health_and_medicine
2317,but that recommendation changes with age adults over age may need just six to seven hours of sleep per night so older people if otherwise healthy should not feel anxious if theyre getting just six hours young people need the most at least nine hours and some younger children may need more,health_and_medicine
2318,fernandezmendoza our team was the first to show that those complaining about insomnia difficulty falling or staying asleep were more likely to have high blood pressure and be at risk for heart disease,health_and_medicine
2319,in both teens and adults we found that insomnia and shortened sleep may lead to elevated stress hormone levels and inflammation these problems tend to show up before you develop heart disease,health_and_medicine
2320,fernandezmendoza good sleep hygiene habits include cutting down on caffeine and alcohol quitting smoking and exercising regularly i also recommend not skipping meals not eating too late at night and not eating too much,health_and_medicine
2321,but people with a persistent sleep problem may need to make more behavioral changes research studies point to a set of six rules that can improve your sleep you can follow these changes consistently in the short term and then choose how to adapt them into your lifestyle down the road,health_and_medicine
2322,first get up at the same time no matter what no matter how much sleep you get this will anchor your sleepwake cycle called your circadian rhythm,health_and_medicine
2323,second do not use your bed for anything except sleep and sexual activity,health_and_medicine
2324,third when you cant sleep dont lie in bed awake instead get out of bed go into another room if you can and do an activity thats enjoyable or relaxing go back to bed only when youre ready to sleep,health_and_medicine
2325,fourth get going with daily activities even after a poor nights sleep dont try to compensate for sleep loss if you have chronic insomnia dont nap sleep in or doze during the day or evening even after poor sleep the previous night,health_and_medicine
2326,fifth go to bed only when youre actually sleepy enough to fall asleep,health_and_medicine
2327,and sixth start with the amount of sleep youre now getting with the lowest limit at five hours and then increase it weekly by minutes,health_and_medicine
2328,these six rules are evidencebased and go above and beyond simple sleep hygiene habits if they dont work see a provider who can help you,health_and_medicine
2329,fernandezmendoza adolescence is a unique developmental period its not just the obvious physical emotional and behavioral changes that occur during adolescence and puberty there are changes in a teenagers brain that can alter their sleep patterns,health_and_medicine
2330,when an adolescent goes through puberty their internal clock changes so that their sleep schedule shifts to later hours while its true that adolescents are more engaged at night because of their social relationships theres also biology behind why they want to stay up late their internal clocks have shifted its not just choice,health_and_medicine
2331,school start times for most adolescents are at odds with that biological shift so they dont get enough sleep which affects their performance in school research suggests that schools with later start times are more closely aligned with the science on child development and dont put adolescents at risk by making them wake up earlier than their bodies are biologically inclined to,health_and_medicine
2332,parents can help their teens get better sleep set a time for kids to stop doing homework and put away electronics instead they can watch tv with the family or read something relaxing and enjoyable that will help them wind down before bed,health_and_medicine
2333,you can also gradually move back their wakeup time start on weekends waking them up minutes earlier every day including school days until the child reaches the desired wakeup time dont try to reshift them suddenly for example waking up a teenager at am like its the military because that doesnt work they wont get used to it since its at odds with their internal clock so do it little by little if that doesnt work see a clinical provider,health_and_medicine
2334,fernandezmendoza people should get help if they feel they sleep poorly if theyre fatigued during the day or if they snore or grind their teeth all these issues deserve attention,health_and_medicine
2335,some people may think a sleep provider just prescribes expensive medication but thats not true there are behavioral nondrugbased treatments that work cognitive behavioral therapy is the firstline treatment recommended for insomnia light therapy may also help which is the use of a bright light therapy lamp at a given time during the day or evening depending on the persons sleep problem,health_and_medicine
2336,this mineral is required to activate vitamin d in the kidney and liver find out if you are consuming enough,health_and_medicine
2337,notably vitamin d tends to undergo two hydroxylation steps to become active in the body,health_and_medicine
2338,studies have shown that magnesium is beneficial in activating vitamin d in the liver and kidneys said dr manjusha agarwal senior consultant internal medicine gleneagles hospital parel mumbai but does the mechanism work in the body,health_and_medicine
2339,magnesium helps the enzymes present in both the liver and the kidneys to complete this process smoothly and efficiently the vitamin d may not be activated properly without enough magnesium this can lead to lower calcium absorption which can negatively hamper bone health said dr rajeshwari panda head of the dietetics department at medicover hospital kharghar navimumbai,health_and_medicine
2340,notably vitamin d tends to undergo two hydroxylation steps to become active the first is calcitriol dihydroxyvitamin d which occurs in the liver wherein the vitamin d is converted into hydroxyvitamin d calcidiol another happens in the kidney where it is converted into dihydroxy vitamin d remember these steps need magnesiumdependent enzymes without the proper amount of magnesium these enzymes will not be able toperformtheir functions as required explained dr agarwal,health_and_medicine
2341,most people primarily get enough magnesium from their daily balanced diet including plenty of green vegetables fruits nuts seeds and whole grains,health_and_medicine
2342,the vitamin d from the sunlight food or supplements goes to the liver and is further converted into a storage form then the kidney later changes it into the active form thatyourbody can use said dr panda,health_and_medicine
2343,moreover dr agarwal said that magnesium regulates parathyroid hormone pth which can impact vitamin d metabolism however it is rare in healthy individuals stressed dr panda,health_and_medicine
2344,experts urge understanding that magnesium is important but is just one factor in activating vitamin d other key nutrients like calcium and vitamin k also play a vital role in the way yourbodyuses vitamin d if you have low vitamin d levels then taking supplements after consulting a doctor and checking your magnesium levels can be helpful said dr panda,health_and_medicine
2345,answered why your gas may be smelly and what it indicates,health_and_medicine
2346,according to dr vikas jindal consultant in the department of gastroenterology at ck birla hospital delhi different types of gas can be associated with specific digestive processes and issues,health_and_medicine
2347,we might not talk about it often but passing gas is a natural part of digestion however the frequency and smell of your farts can actually reveal a lot about your gut health,health_and_medicine

2349,if youve noticed thatyour gas has a strong odourit could point to underlying digestive issues or imbalances according to dr jindal a particularly smelly fart may suggest problems like slow transit time dysbiosis an imbalance in your gut bacteria or conditions like irritable bowel syndrome ibs or inflammatory bowel disease ibd these conditions can disrupt the normal digestion process leading to bacteria breaking down undigested food more slowly and producing smelly gases,health_and_medicine
2350,constipation another common digestive issue can also contribute to odour as food sits longer in the digestive tract providing bacteria more time to release gases small intestinal bacterial overgrowth sibo is another condition that can produce foulsmelling gas due to the excess bacterial fermentation in the small intestine,health_and_medicine
2351,nonsmelly farts are typically a result of carbohydrate or fibre intolerance dr jindal explains foods that contain certain sugars like lactose in milk fructose in fruits or sugar alcohols in sugarfree products can cause gas without a strong odour this type of gas is often a byproduct of your gut bacteria fermenting undigested carbs and fibres which indicates that your microbiome is functioning but may have difficulty with certain foods,health_and_medicine
2352,while occasional gas is a normal part of digestion consistently smelly or excessive gas may point to digestive issues dr jindal notes if your gas is frequently foulsmelling it may be due to poor digestion or an imbalanced gut microbiome which can indicate gastrointestinal disorders like gerd or crohns disease similarly frequent nonsmelly gas can also signal issues like difficulty digesting certain carbohydrates enzyme deficiencies or food intolerances,health_and_medicine
2353,both types of gas when coupled with other symptoms like bloating abdominal pain or irregular bowel movements may warrant a visit to a healthcare provider for further evaluation,health_and_medicine

2396,sports and energy drinks are not the same heres how they affect the body particularly digestive health,health_and_medicine
2397,designed for rehydration during physical activity sports drinks contain electrolytes sodium potassium and carbohydrates sugars,health_and_medicine
2398,many people including us purchase sports and energy drinks thinking they are the same however on closer inspection one can trace the differences between them if consultant neurologist dr sudhir kumar apollo hospitals hyderabad is to go by sports drinks contain nutrients that are often lost during vigorous exercise including sugar while energy drinks contain sugar and stimulants such as caffeine and taurine,health_and_medicine
2399,a good rule of thumb is to save sports drinks for exercise that lasts for more than an hour or that takes place in very hot or humid conditions while energy drinks containing caffeine may energise the body temporarily they do not replenish the nutrients moreover caffeine is a diuretic which can lead to dehydration the stimulants inenergy drinkscan also pose other potential health risks in children and adolescents including adverse effects on their developing hearts and brains it is better to avoid consuming energy drinks in children or keep their consumption to the lowest possible said dr kumar in a post on x,health_and_medicine
2400,this makes it essential to understand the differences between sports andenergy drinksand how they affect the body particularly digestive health these are two distinct drinks with different purposes formulas and ingredients said dr veena pai dietitian lilavati hospitalmumbai,health_and_medicine
2401,sports drinks as the names suggest are mostly preferred by the athletes or people who indulge in various sports activities the purpose here of drinking sports drinks is to replenish the amount of carbohydrates electrolytes and fluids that are lost during intense sports sessions they often contain balanced ingredients this may include ingredients like sugar for quick energy release in the body and electrolytes like sodium and potassium to maintain hydration described dr pai,health_and_medicine
2402,designed for rehydration duringphysical activity sports drinks contain electrolytes sodium potassium in addition to carbohydrates sugars,health_and_medicine
2403,theyre generally safe for the digestive system although high sugar content may occasionally cause gastrointestinal discomfort particularly for sensitive stomachs however for most people engaged in intense physical activity they offer a balanced way to stay hydrated and fuelled said dr nadendla hazarathaiah consultant surgical gastroenterologist gi oncology gleneagles global hospitals lakdikapulhyderabad,health_and_medicine
2404,energy drinks on the other hand are formulated to boost energy andalertness primarily through high doses of caffeine and sugar they primarily act as a stimulant these energy drinks are jampacked with ingredients such as caffeine and sugar along with stimulants like guarana taurine and ginseng energy drinks contain very less nutritional levels compared to sports drinks they contain excessive amounts of sugar which can be harmful to your physical wellbeing if consumed frequently said dr pai,health_and_medicine
2405,these can pose risks to the gastrointestinal system high caffeine levels may increase acid production in the stomach potentially leading to issues like acid reflux or gastritis said dr hazarathaiah,health_and_medicine
2406,dr sudhir kumar md dm hyderabaddoctoroctober,health_and_medicine
2407,while sports drinks can be beneficial forhydrationduring intense exercise energy drinks should be consumed with caution due to their potential to disrupt gastrointestinal health particularly with regular use said dr hazarathaiah,health_and_medicine
2408,however dr pai said that one shouldnt go overboard when drinking these drinks be it sports drinks or energy drinks instead opt for healthier alternatives like lemonade coconut water or vegetable juice said dr pai,health_and_medicine

2412,the unplanned extension has tested the astronauts adaptability as they have had to wait for the formulation of a safe return plan meanwhile its longterm effects on their bodies cannot be ignored astronauts in space experience significant physiological changes due to prolonged exposure to microgravity radiation and isolation the toll on muscles bones and even mental health can be severe but what exactly happens when a mission lasts much longer than expected,health_and_medicine
2413,dr raghu nagaraj director of the institute of orthopaedics sports medicine and robotic joint replacement at kauvery hospitalsbengaluru shares insights on the health risks both astronauts may face after spending nine months in space,health_and_medicine
2414,in microgravity muscles especially those in the lower back legs and core lose mass and strength because they are not being used to support body weight similarly bones particularly in the spine hips and legs undergo mineral loss increasing the risk of fractures upon their return to earth astronauts may experience difficulty standing walking and balancing as their musculoskeletal systems readjust to gravity explains dr nagaraj,health_and_medicine
2415,williams spoke about the emotional challenge of waiting for a return date dr nagaraj notes that prolonged isolation and uncertainty can causestress anxiety and even depression to maintain mental wellbeing space agencies implement structured routines scheduled communications with family and psychologists and recreational activities like movies music and reading,health_and_medicine
2416,additionally astronauts are trained in resiliencebuilding techniques to manage stress once back on earth they often undergo psychological debriefings and counselling to reintegrate smoothly into normal life he says,health_and_medicine

2428,he is the first person to leave the hospital with the bivacor device which serves as a temporary solution for people with heart failure while previous recipients remained under constant medical supervision this case marks a major breakthrough in understanding how patients adapt to the device outside a hospital setting,health_and_medicine
2429,the man now recovering after a successful heart transplant is the sixth person globally to receive the bivacor heart but the first to live with it for over a month according tothe guardian prof chris hayward a cardiologist at st vincents who led the observation of the man in after a few weeks in the intensive care unit said the bivacor total artificial heart ushers in a whole new ball game forheart transplants both in australia and internationally he added within the next decade we will see the artificial heart becoming the alternative for patients who are unable to wait for a donor heart or when a donor heart is simply not available,health_and_medicine
2430,this milestone could pave the way for broader use of artificial hearts however questions remain about the longterm viability of such technology its cost and the quality of life it offers,health_and_medicine
2431,dr cm nagesh general secretary of the indian college of cardiology tells,health_and_medicine
2433,that the bivacor total artificial heart tah is a breakthrough in cardiac technology while currently a bridge to transplant its potential as a longterm solution is promising especially for patients ineligible for transplants its rotary pump reduces mechanical wear but longterm studies on durability and complications are needed future advancements in battery life portability and materials could make it a viable permanent option,health_and_medicine
2435,despite advancements artificial heart patients face mobility and lifestyle challenges devices like bivacor require external power sources limiting physical activity and travel says dr nagesh theres also a risk of infection at connection points and a need for constant monitoring toprevent clotting psychological adjustments adapting to a mechanical heartbeat and regular medical followups are crucial for patients,health_and_medicine
2436,with heart failure affecting millions and donor shortages persisting artificial hearts could be a gamechanger however widespread accessibility depends on cost infrastructure and regulatory approvals explains dr nagesh currently these devices are expensive and require specialized expertise limiting access research should focus on cost reduction simplified procedures and longterm reliability increased healthcare investment especially in countries like india is essential to make this technology widely available,health_and_medicine
2437,the survival of an australian patient for days with a titanium artificial heart is a landmark achievement in cardiac medicine this case demonstrates thatmechanical heartscan provide meaningful survival periods while awaiting transplants paving the way for further innovation in longterm solutions notes dr nagesh,health_and_medicine
2438,in india he adds where heart disease is a leading cause of mortality and donor shortages persist such technology could be revolutionary however challenges such as affordability accessibility and training of specialised cardiac surgeons need to be addressed if artificial heart technology can be made more costeffective and adaptable to indian healthcare settings it could provide a crucial lifeline to thousands of patients suffering from endstage heart failure,health_and_medicine

2445,gut health nutritionist payal kothari explained that a mono diet includes eating only one food for to hours a philosophy based on the minimalist way of living and eating,health_and_medicine

2451,jaya bachchan has given more stellar performances than amitabh bachchan but he is the tree who casts a shadow over the family,entertainment
2452,jaya bachchan was never the glamorous heroine who played a sidekick in male dominated films but in fact she was the actor who often had the meatiest part in a film,entertainment
2453,a few months ago when jaya bachchan was addressed as jaya amitabh bachchan during a rajya sabha session it ignited a heated debate jaya said that while she was extremely proud of her husband and his achievements she found this address extremely patriarchal the debate started because a few days before this exchange jaya had brought up the fact that the society likes to recognise a woman by her husbands nameas if they have no existence or achievements of their ownjaya isnot that womanof course she is married to amitabh bachchan who is often regarded as one of the best actors of indian cinema of all time and some might even say that his achievements have overshadowed everything that the bachchan family might do for the many generations to come but that doesnt take away from the fact that in some ways jaya is ahead of him when it comes to choosing films that are arguably better,entertainment
2454,jaya is one of those rare gifted actors whose artistry was first spotted by the great satyajit ray himself in mahanagar all of she acted opposite madhabi mukherjee and anil chatterjee in the film that remains one of the greatest works of the thespian her undeniable talent brought her topursue the acting course at ftii in the sand soon afterwards she was the talent to watch out for she wasnt the glamorous heroine who decorated a frame like a flower pot in male dominated films but in fact she was the actor who often had the meatiest part in a film whether it was starring in eponymous films such as guddi and mili to playing women who stood up for themselves in films such as piya ka ghar and uphaar to sensitive portrayals like abhimaan and koshish,entertainment
2455,even when amitabh was trying to make it big in the movies jaya was the next big actor to watch out for much likeirrfan she wasnt the actor whose performance was dependent on her director costars or her surroundings she did a stellar job nevertheless if she signed up for a role one could expect that the film wouldnt be a disappointment which one cannot say for amitabhs choices,entertainment
2456,it would be unfair to compare the talent of actors like jaya and amitabh but there is one thing which places jaya ahead of amitabh she has never given a mediocre performance in any film she has chosen to do a large part of her filmography the likes of guddi mili parichay kora kagaz stands the test of time and the few films that dont still have her giving a nearflawless performance it is important to remember here that the success of any film cannot be measured by its popularity or box office success at that time but how it has aged and continued to entertained the audience even decades of its original release,entertainment
2457,it would be unfair to compare the talent of actors like jaya and amitabh but there is one thing which places jaya ahead of amitabh she has never given a mediocre performance in any film she has chosen to do of course she has also appeared in films which cant be labeled as good like jawani diwani samadhi gaai aur gori among a few others but even in these films jaya does not lose her grip like injawani diwanishe is introduced as a collegegoing woman who walks around with a doll in her hand but jaya cant get herself to infantilise the character in her daytoday behaviour instead she chooses to retain her childlike innocence just so she can justify the doll or in a film like samadhi a fatherson bandit drama where she is seen romancingdharmendrain a doublerole you wonder if she was cast just to legitimise a truly overthetop premise that could have existed only in the s much like howirrfan khan was great even in an anees bazmee filmjaya was great in everything she appeared in but the same cant be said for amitabh as he has had his bad luck with films like insaniyat lal baadshah kohram boom nishabdrgv ki aagand a few other that he did during his low phase,entertainment
2458,unlike other members of her family jayas reputation as an actor was well known in the film industry even before she made her debut in the movies she had just finished her course at ftii when she landed hrishikesh mukherjees guddi and soon after she appeared in some of the best films of the time it is well known thatsalimjaved had to convince jaya to take up a smaller part in zanjeerjust so they could convince prakash mehra to make the film with amitabh who was yet to prove his mettle it was almost as if her star power could build some trust in the film before the audience gave a chance to amitabh of course one can argue that amitabh has worked in a lot more movies and the more one tries the bigger the probability of them failing but this still doesnt take away from jayas wise choices across her career,entertainment
2459,at a time when most hindi films had a happy ending where the man and woman get married jaya did a series of roles where she explored what happens after the socalled happy ending in many films during this time she chose to play a newly wed who is pushed into an alien world where is she expected to be fluent in a language that she is just starting to learn,entertainment
2460,inuphaar she plays a carefree womanwho is too young to understand the idea of marriage in a scene in the film her character just walks out of hersasuralbecause she wants to meet her father the father lives in a different village and she has no idea how to get there after walking around for hours she gets tired and sleeps on the side of the pavement this girl could have come across as irresponsible and careless but jaya ensures that her childlike innocence comes across and you feel sympathetic towards her,entertainment
2461,in piya ka ghar her character is expected to live within a seven person household in a house thats barely big enough for four the lack of privacy and the absence of any space for intimacy drives her to put her foot down and demand a better life or at least the acknowledgement that what shes asking for isnt unreasonable what could have come across as vamplike in ekta kapoors worldjaya ensures it looks like standing up for yourselfand your desires,entertainment
2462,in abhimaan she isexpected to be the subservient wifewho should be proud of her talent but never dream of overshadowing her husband played byamitabh bachchan the moment her natural talent shines through all hell breaks loose jaya could have played her character like a pushover who acts like a fly on the wall but she chooses to play it as a woman who knows her worth and is shocked to find out that her husband wallows in selfpity instead of having a mature conversation,entertainment
2463,after a relatively short first innings jaya returned to the screen in the late s and early s and in this phase of her career she frequently revisited the character of thefilmy maabut every single time she picked up a version of this character she chose to hold on to a different facet of the saidmaaspersonality like in govind nihalanis hazaar chaurasi ki maa jaya played a mother who is trying to get to know her dead son as she is struggling to piece together his life every new thing that she learns about him comes as a shock to her but jaya doesnt play it with an air of unbelievability or shock but rather she presents her as someone who is curious to find out about the life he left behind,entertainment
2465,jaya chose to follow the path of public service instead of being a full time actor even after she rejoined films as couple of decades ago but if she were to do more films it would definitely be a treat for her fans across the globe,entertainment
2466,loveyapa junaid khan plays the worlds biggest red flag again this time in advait chandans outdated romantic comedy,entertainment
2467,post credits scene played by junaid khan the male protagonist of loveyapa seems to be bizarrely obsessed about the purity of his girlfriend played by khushi kapoor,entertainment
2468,if bollywood were any more exploitative than it already is it wouldve gotthe struggling dibakar banerjeeto direct loveyapa as a gunforhire but then it wouldnt have been the same garbage movie banerjee wouldve spotted the inherent toxicity of its protagonists played by twotime offenderskhushi kapoorand junaid khan and attempted to unpack the patriarchal systems that made them this way had banerjee directed this movie khan wouldve almost certainly become a mascot for toxic masculinity at just two films old the only difference is that maharaj his debut film hadno ideathat his character was a terrible person loveyapa on the other hand appears to at least recognise his flaws but expects you to root for him regardless,entertainment
2469,directed by advait chandan and cowritten by sneha desai both haveworked with aamir khan before loveyapa debuted on jiohotstar recently following a dismal theatrical run it wouldnt take a genius to identify why audiences didnt connect with the movie but one viewing is enough to make you wonder why it exists in the first place devoid of any personality whatsoever mired in tired tropes and tonally shrill to the point of being violent loveyapa is a particularly unbearable example of older folks trying and failing spectacularly to understand the younger generation if the movie itself has such disdain for its characters how can it expect the audience to be forgiving of them,entertainment
2470,the primary problem with films like loveyapa is that instead ofempathising with the youth they want to chastise them an entire scene is dedicated to the protagonist guccis mother giving him a lecture about how smartphones are the root of all evil its like a judge delivering a sermon tosaif ali khans stabber about the dangers posed by kitchen cutlery theyre missing the point infidelity as an idea isnt restricted to one generation dont we know this already people have been cheating on their partners since before the concept of monogamy was conceived but youd imagine that domestic violence is something that as a society were consciously trying to abolish,entertainment
2471,gucci doesnt have a domineering dad in loveyapa and yet he has the mentality of one at one point in the film after pounding an adversary to a pulp he instinctively raises his fist to punch his girlfriend baani in the face for those keeping score at home this is the second time in a row that khan has played a dude who has contemplated beating his partner inmaharaj the heroic character he played shamed his fianc for being coerced into having sex with a powerful godman in loveyapa guccis outburst can be blamed on him being a delhiite thats the extent to which the movie attempts to investigate his issues needless to say it doesnt matter that these characters didnt actually hit their partners because as we all should know by now there is no difference between a man who hits women and a man whothinksabout hitting them,entertainment
2472,in loveyapa baani accuses gucci of being a psychopath pervert sex maniac she also correctly recognises that he was probably running a casting couch scam on the internet by promising women roles in his imaginary short film in exchange for certain favours this is sextortion baani tells him in one scene indicating that loveyapa at least hasan ideaof right and wrong so why does it behave like guccis bizarre obsession with baani being pure is normal i know you arent that kind of girl he tells her after another creep makes a deepfake video of her and releases it online it doesnt matter to gucci that his girlfriend has been made a victim of revenge porn all he seems to care about is if shes still a virgin baanis dad played by ashutosh rana uses deeply unsettling language while discussing their relationship he equates dating baani with gaining entry in her ew,entertainment
2473,a smarter movie a movie with banerjee hypothetically at the helm wouldve tried to understand why gucci is soinfluenced by patriarchal ideas but this would only have been possible if it had the intelligence to even discern good behaviour from bad the only reason he doesnt force himself on her he admits in one scene is because he satiates his urges by watching all sorts of porn what a bonkers thing to admit repeat after me there is no difference between a rapist and someone who contemplates being one baani would do well to stay away from someone like him if she werent such a red flag herself,entertainment
2474,during the course of the movie it is revealed that she was going on secret dates with her exes after lying to gucci about her whereabouts unlike gucci who raises his fist to punch her but doesnt follow through on his indefensible instincts baani actually slaps him across the face in one scene for being obnoxious loveyapa seems to be smugly taunting feminists having taken the decidedly problematic position of a mens rights activist movies like this fail to understand that our problem isnt withmenhitting women orwomenhitting men our problem is with physical violence period by having baani hit gucci loveyapa seems to be raising its eyebrow in our direction and asking what do you have to say now all you can do is heave a sigh of disappointment a lot of work remains to be done,entertainment

2480,sharma worked in many different restaurants as an assistant chef to make ends meet and shared an anecdote from one of his many jobs in the culinary sphere i even worked in an irish restaurant where i had to cut and clean the raw meat and i am vegetarian i had no other prospects and i had no money so i remember praying to god and asking whether this is his plan for me the very next day i landed my first editing job at a big channel in toronto,entertainment

2562,why ncdrc called the current crypto regime nebulous dismissed wazirx case,crime_and_law
2563,the ncdrc did not comment on the measures wazirx could have taken to prevent a security breach or the losses to investors,crime_and_law
2564,underlining the continued lack of clarity on the issue of cryptocurrency regulation the national consumer disputes redressal commission ncdrc last week dismissed a lawsuit by investors against wazirx a cryptocurrency exchange focused on the indian market,crime_and_law
2565,investors approached the ncdrc claiming a deficiency in service by wazirx after a cybersecurity breach last july saw the firm lose about million they argued that wazirx failed to implement adequate security measures allowing the cyberattack to take place,crime_and_law
2566,in its ruling the ncdrc held that the governance regime for cryptocurrency was nebulous and that the consumer court does not have jurisdiction to hear the case it did not comment on the measures wazirx could have taken to prevent a security breach or the losses to investors,crime_and_law
2567,on july over million or about of the value of wazirxs digital asset holdings were withdrawn from one of its multisig wallets a multisig or multisignature wallet requires a user to provide two or more private keys for authentication before a transaction can be processed and confirmed,crime_and_law
2568,the company immediately halted withdrawals on the platform even as users incurred massive losses in september a singapore court granted a fourmonth moratorium on any proceedings against it further halting withdrawals wazirx has since claimed that the north koreabased lazarus group was responsible for the attack,crime_and_law
2569,in january indian users approached the ncdrc claiming a deficiency in the services provided by wazirx they also alleged that the platform was indulging in unfair trade practices by halting withdrawals,crime_and_law
2570,the ncdrc considered two questions in the case first whether cryptocurrency could be considered a good under the consumer protection act cpa second whether it could hear the case at all,crime_and_law
2571,under section of the cpa the term goods means every kind of movable property the ncdrc acknowledged that cryptocurrencies officially dubbed virtual digital assets vda are included in the definition of property under the income tax act and taxed at a rate of since april however the ncdrc repeatedly flags the lack of clarity in this field noting that,crime_and_law
2572,the connection between vdas and consumer services is still in a nebulous state,crime_and_law
2573,the reserve bank of india has not yet taken any responsibility by regulating platforms like wazirx even though concerns have been raised about financial crisis occurring in the offing,crime_and_law
2574,ultimately the ncdrc did not clarify cryptos status as a good stating on the one hand they can be treated to be digital products as they are digital goods but they are still not recognised as currencies or securities,crime_and_law
2575,the ncdrc said there are no laws to regulate or even provide legal measures for tackling such claims it also noted that there are several different aspects to consider in a case like this including the criminal aspects of the complaint against wazirx as it paints a picture of fraud committed against the users depending on the nature of the deception alleged the ncdrc also said the prevention of money laundering act could also apply,crime_and_law
2576,it thus ruled that the consumer forum ncdrc may not be that well equippedto carry out investigations into the alleged breach the ncdrc indicated that either the legislature or a judicial platform like the sc or a high court would have to declare that such cases could be heard in the consumer court before it takes any action,crime_and_law
2577,while possessing and making transactions with cryptocurrency has not been outlawed the reserve bank of india has not recognised it as legal tender and has attempted to impose significant restrictions on it in the past noting the various risks associated with virtual currencies vcs the rbi in issued a notification stating that entities regulated by rbi shall not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling vcs importantly the rbi did not impose an outright ban on crypto trading but instead focused on entities such as banks and financial institutions to prevent them from facilitating such activities,crime_and_law
2578,however the supreme court struck down this particular notification in while holding that the rbi could in fact regulate vcs it ruled that the notification disproportionately impacted the rights of those running vc exchanges under article g of the constitution which gives all citizens the right to practise any profession or to carry out any occupation trade or business according to the sc the rbi failed to prove that vc exchanges have damaged the functioning of financial institutions,crime_and_law

2591,at the time she thought their interactions had been merely awkward but as she scrolled through sheils photos on instagram for the first time in nearly a year she said gifford suspected those meetings had been some kind of aesthetic espionage,crime_and_law
2592,gifford claims that sheil not only started to mimic her online persona but also appropriated her entire look and now she is suing,crime_and_law

2594,this isnt a coincidence gifford who has about followers on instagram and more than on tiktok recalled thinking at the time something is definitely happening here,crime_and_law
2595,what might appear to be a superficial spat over sweaters and hairstyles could actually be a legal fight that gets at the heart of social mediainfluence the very nature of successful trendsetting requires some degree of replication as much as platforms like tiktok and instagram may seem like freeforalls lifestyle influencers exist in an ecosystem that prizes homogeneity one of the surer ways to appease the algorithms that are the ultimate arbiters of their success online,crime_and_law

2597,in several interviews beginning in august experts said influencers have to navigate a blurry landscape in which assigning credit to who created what can be daunting and in some cases impossible,crime_and_law
2598,there really is a sense that youre both a creator and a borrower said jeanne fromer a professor of intellectual property law at new york university fashion is built on that all the creative industries painting music movies theyre all built on borrowing in certain ways from the past and also ideally trying to bring your own spin to something i dont know that anyone wants to go too far as a result,crime_and_law
2599,sheil said that giffords claims about her posts were unfounded and that she found them deeply upsetting as an influencer in her own right,crime_and_law
2600,this is how i make my living and not only that this is my personal brand sheil said in an interview i kind of feel like i need to defend myself,crime_and_law
2601,fromer described the lawsuit as one of the first of its kind in which one social media user is suing another rather than the tech company behind the platform despite its seeming outlandishness this kitchen sink intellectual property complaint could hold up in court she said adding that the most substantial claim was copyright infringement,crime_and_law
2602,depending on what comes of the lawsuit it could set an important precedent for other influencers and how they present themselves online,crime_and_law
2603,the first time gifford and sheil met at a luxury outdoor mall in austin texas sheil felt like a third wheel,crime_and_law
2604,according to sheil gifford had sent her a private message on instagram asking if she wanted to hang out with her and another influencer friend the women walked around perused the offerings at hm and aritzia had lunch and went their separate ways,crime_and_law
2605,i was definitely anxious because they were already friends sheil said i didnt really know what i was walking into with them already being friends and it went ok,crime_and_law
2606,gifford described the gettogether as professional and said it was mainly to film content and bounce ideas off one another,crime_and_law
2607,i really dont recall who reached out to who said gifford who now lives in minnesota i know we had been mutually following each other for a while so im not sure who initiated it,crime_and_law

2610,when sheil went home she blocked gifford across all platforms,crime_and_law
2611,i didnt really see anything wrong with blocking her sheil said i didnt feel welcome i didnt feel like that was someone that i needed to have a relationship with on social media if the relationship we had in real life wasnt good,crime_and_law
2612,for gifford the lawsuit isnt a matter of personal pride its about protecting her business,crime_and_law
2613,gifford and sheil both create social media content meant to induce their followers to buy items tumblers coffee tables pajama sets from their amazon storefronts this is how both women make their living they said and it is what gifford is claiming in her lawsuit that sheil infringed on by copying her posts and aesthetic,crime_and_law
2614,there were multiple people some followers some close friends of mine that her content had popped up on their for you page and they thought it was mine genuinely gifford said during a video interview from minnesota,crime_and_law
2615,they obviously looked at the name on the account and were confused gifford said of her followers who she said alerted her to the similarities in their content it was very emotional to see that,crime_and_law
2616,this confusion by her followers is a focus of giffords suit she also said that she had noticed a dip in the sales of items she posted about when sheil made a post similar to hers citing information from amazon in the lawsuit gifford identified a list of items that she claims sheil copied from her posts and sold on her amazon storefront items she said that she spends considerable amounts of time curating,crime_and_law
2617,over the summer lawyers for sheil filed a motion to dismiss most of the charges presented in the complaint decrying giffords throw everything at the wall and see what sticks approach sheils lawyers suggested that the overarching theme of giffords gripe is that she believes sheils posts and overall aesthetics are too similar to giffords,crime_and_law
2618,but that they maintain is an unenforceable claim under the digital millennium copyright act which comes into effect only when an identical work is altered or reproduced without the appropriate copyright information,crime_and_law
2619,because the complaint only alleges the creation of similar images not the reproduction of identical ones sheils lawyers contended giffords dmca claim fails as a matter of law,crime_and_law
2620,last month a magistrate judge recommended that sheils motion to dismiss be granted in part and denied in part her lawyers said last month that they were weighing how they want to proceed,crime_and_law
2621,in january gifford applied and paid for copyrights of several of her social media posts that she claims sheil copied although the copyright registrations give her grounds to claim infringement they do not ensure ownership of a style media or even likeness rather they are simply a ticket to court according to rose leda ehler a litigator at the los angeles law firm munger tolles olson,crime_and_law
2622,do i think its going to make it all the way to trial or become a really big case in the world of copyrights and trademark law no ehler said in a phone interview i suspect that there will be discussions outside of the courtroom and the parties will probably figure out or resolve the matter short of it going all the way to trial,crime_and_law
2623,similar cases that have been litigated in court have had surprising outcomes in photographer jacobus rentmeester sued nike claiming that the athletic apparel giant copied his photo of michael jordan to create the companys jumpman logo which it used in its iconic air jordan campaign,crime_and_law

2625,a similar case a decade earlier had a different outcome in photographer jonathan mannion sued an advertising agency for using a modified version of a photo he had taken in of basketball star kevin garnett in a coors light ad mannion won his lawsuit after the court observed that the ad agency had recreated the photo of garnett through imitation of angle pose composition and lighting,crime_and_law

2710,medicine the doctor responds with devastating simplicity all the child needs is some food seitas heartrending reply still reverberates through my soul fifteen years after i first encountered this moment she needs food where am i supposed to get food,technology
2711,this haunting scene belongs tograve of the fireflies one of studio ghiblis animated masterpieces i cannot summon memories of this film without tears welling up in my eyes if granted a superpower i would make it compulsory viewing in every educational institution worldwide so that no one forgets that every war everywhere is a story written on the dead bodies of children but despite my passionate efforts all ive managed in the last decade and a half is to persuade a handful to experience this nearly yearold cinematic treasure,technology
2713,to my shocked delight everything changed after a studio ghibliinspired imagegeneration feature in openais chatgpt went suddenly viral and how from college students in coimbatore to my nephews in assam ive fielded inquiries about which ghibli films deserve priority viewing names i hadnt uttered in years my neighbor totorocastle in the skyprincess mononokespirited awaynausica of the valley of the windhowls moving castle and my belovedgrave of the fireflies now slip off my tongue like a skater gliding across ice formed from my tears of gratitude openais feature has unexpectedly sparked such an overwhelming interest in the art craft and heart of studio ghiblis works that it has crashed the generative ai companys gpus forcing ceo sam altman to plead with people not to overuse the feature as much,technology
2714,but surprisesurprise not everyones happy with this viral moment first are the copyright advocates whose concerns about potential legal infractions are genuine and understandable many such cases are ongoing worldwide less comprehensible at least to me is the resurfaced video of studio cofounder hayao miyazaki denouncing aigenerated art as an insult to life itself this archival clip has gone viral enthusiastically propagated by many including all ai detractors at a pace that ironically rivals the spread of ghiblis artistry into the worlds zeitgeist in this very surreal moment,technology
2715,i have two concerns with this narrative first miyazakis comments have been taken out of their original context second i believe that this cultural phenomenon represents the biggest reward for both miyazaki and studio ghibli allow me to address both points,technology
2716,in the nowviral video which is eight years old and i suspect is from a documentary about thesensei miyazaki is reacting to an aigenerated animation featuring a grotesque creature similar to the monsters in horror games likeresident evil he watches as this unsettling entity drags itself forward using its head as an unnatural disturbing propellant for its motion,technology
2717,the man showing this video to miyazaki says that because ai cant perceive pain or selfpreservation instincts they can create such creatures that are usable in zombiethemed games miyazaki is disgusted and says the creature reminds him of a friend with a disability he thinks the imagery is a repugnant dehumanising attempt at art declaring that it constitutes an insult to life itself,technology
2718,miyazaki explained his revulsion further stating he would never incorporate such elements into his work and interpreted such developments as symptomatic of humanitys diminishing faith in itself suggesting i feel like we are nearing the end of times,technology
2719,we must first understand that miyazakis reaction was specifically targeted at the grotesque inhuman creation he had just witnessed attributing these same characteristics to the ai that generated the video,technology
2720,furthermore if miyazaki truly meant to condemn ai in general as an insult to life as many now assume with all respect due to him we must recognise this as emblematic of the selfrighteousness that afflicts many elders who often perceive innovations embraced by younger generations as affronts to established traditions i felt artists would have a greater immunity to this tendency but clearly i am wrong,technology
2721,when miyazaki began crafting animation films years ago people as old as he is right now likely directed similar criticisms at him that this novel medium of camerabased art forms including animated films constituted an insult to life itself consider that throughout the millions of years of bipedal existence on earth we have experienced cinema for merely a century and a quarter it would not be wrong to call it unnatural to life itself if miyazaki rejected characterisations of his chosen medium as an abomination six decades ago then he must extend the same courtesy to this generation and their innovative artistic approaches even if they utilise ai,technology
2722,most significantly i truly think that this moment is miyazakis greatest celebration when a teenage girl from valparai a small village nestled in the anamalai hills kilometres from coimbatore wonders about studio ghibli or hayao miyazaki this curiosity surpasses any accolade they have received or might receive including oscars failing to recognise the profound significance of this moment is devastatingly shortsighted after all every artist myself included ultimately yearns for their creations conceived in cerebral solitude to find every drop of appreciation they can garner in this busy world this adulation is more than every lifetime achievement award ever something many creators would wager their souls for if it guaranteed such recognition,technology
2723,an entire new generation has awakened to the gentle power of studio ghiblis cinematic poetry while i cannot speak for the studios creators i quietly celebrate this moment reminded of another poignant line fromgrave of the fireflieswhen little setsuko asks her brother with innocent melancholy why do fireflies have to die so soon every artist resembles a firefly we illuminate this world with a brief flicker during our finite existence only to be forgotten the moment were gone to have that flicker amplified exponentially even for a fleeting viral moment transcends what any artist might reasonably hope to achieve in our fragile world,technology
2724,rather than dismissing these aigenerated tributes perhaps we should view them as digital fireflies ephemeral but luminous celebrations of an artistic legacy that continues to inspire across generations and technologies in their viral glow new eyes are discovering the original masterpieces that have moved hearts and squeezed tear ducts for decades ensuring that studio ghiblis light will continue to shine long after individual fireflieslike miyazaki himselffade into the night,technology
